Investigation:1.2  
Determine the area of cross section of a circular wire.  
Objective : Determination of the diameter of the wire by using screw gauge.  
Theory : Area of any substance is its surface area. If any wire is cut at right-angle with 
the length, then the surface obtained is the area of cross section of the wire. If the area of 
circular cross section of a wire is A then  
A = πr2, Here r = Radius of the wire  
                      π = 3.14 (22/7) a constant  
If the diameter of the wire is d, then r = d/2

Procedure :  
1.  At first the value of the smallest divisions of linear scale and the total number of

Position :  Where is your school ? In answer to  this question we will know the position 
of your school. If you say your school is in Jheeltuli it is absolutely true but we cannot know the exact position of your school fro m this information. We can know the exact 
position only when you mention the position, direction and distance of your school with 
respect to a particulars place. At first we have to consider a known point or an object with respect to that the position of another point or object is to be determined. For 
example, if said your school is one kilometer apart in the east from the gate of your 
residence, its position can be told certainly. We have to consider a particular point to find out the position of our village or town, country or the world or the universe around 
us. This point is called reference point or origin and fixed object with respect to which","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 31}"
86,"we find out the position, rest and motion of another object is known as reference frame. Any point can be considered as reference point for our convenience. In the above 
example we could consider any other point as reference point.  
Rest and motion :  We see many object around us of them some are rest and some are in 
motion. What do we actually mean by rest and moving object.  
 
What is there around the pen ? Does the position of the pen get changed with respect to 
other objects around ? It does not. The pen in your has a particulars distance and 
direction with respect to the objects around you such as your chair, table, book, copy, house, door, window and to all other things. So  the position of your pen is fixed with 
respect to other objects around you. The position of the pen is not changing with the","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 31}"
87,"change of time. We can say the pen is in rest to the surroundings. The act of remain rest of the pen is called rest. Therefore, a body is said to be static or at rest with respect to its 
surroundings when it does not change its position with time.  
Ani is standing by the side of the road. He said that, houses, plants and trees, electric 
poles etc are standing at rest. Why does he say so ? According to Ani those objects are 
not changing their positions with respect to time.  
 
 
Does the position of the pen change with  respect to the objects around, the position and 
direction of the pen is gradually changing with respects to each object of its surrounding. The position of the pen is changing with time. We say the pen is in motion with respect 
to the surroundings. A body is said to be in motion with respect to its surroundings when 
it changes its position with time. And this change of position with time is called motion.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 31}"

considered object and the reference object remain unchanged with time, the considered 
object is said to be in rest with respect to reference object. If the considered object and 
the reference object move along the same direction with same velocity even though the 
distance between the objects, remain unchanged despite the object, being in motion. If two friends remain seated face to face in a running train, then the relative position of one 
with respect to other does not change. So one is said to have in rest with respect to other. 
When a person observes these two friends standi ng by the side of the train line he will 
see their position is changing with respect to him. That is both the two friends are in 
motion with respect to the person standing by the side of the train line.   
So we see that an object is actually in rest or not depends on the reference object. If the 
reference frame is actually in rest, object in re st will be : actually in rest with respect to","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 32}"
90,"that frame. This type of rest is called absolute rest. A body is said to be in absolutely rest 
when it is in rest with respect to an absolutely rest object.  
Similarly absolute motion of a body is its motion with respect to a reference object 
absolutely at rest. But in this universe it is not possible to get a reference object which is at absolute rest. Since the earth is continuously moving round the sun, while the sun itself is moving along the galaxy with its planets and satellites. Thus when we say that a body is at rest or in motion, we mean it is to be so with respect to a body apparently at rest. So we can say that in this universe all rest and all motion are relative. No rest or no 
motion is absolute.  
Mitu is waiting for a bus at the bus stand to go somewhere. She notices her friend Roni 
crossing her by rickshaw. She says that the rickshaw is in motion because it is changing

b) A large circular tract is made in the school field of Raju for race of annual sports. He 
notices his friend Shihab practicing to running along that track standing at the centre of the trac (Fig 2.1 (b)). Raju says Shihab is in motion but the distance between them is not

In the first example, the position of Awishi is changing with respect to Mou with the 
change of distance and time. In the second example, the position of Shihab is changing 
with respect to Raju with time but the distance is not changing. What is changing then ? 
The direction of position of Shihab is changing with respect to Raju. The position of a moving body with respect to an observer can be taken place either indirection or in 
distance or by both.  
2.2 Types of motion  Linear motion :  If a body is in motion along a straight line, that is, if the motion of a 
body is restricted on a straight line its motion is called linear motion. The motion of a car in a straight street is linear motion.  
Rotational motion : When a body rotates around a particular point or an axis keeping 
the distance of the particles of the body unchanged is called rotational motion. For","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 33}"
93,"example, motion of an electric fan, motion of the heads of a clock.  
Rectilinear motion : When a body moves along a straight line in such a way that each 
particle of the body travels the same distance at the same time in the same direction.  
If a book is pushed to shift from one end to the other of a table without rotation, the 
motion will be rectilinear because all the particles of the book travel the equal distance, 
at equal time in the same direction.  
Periodic motion : If the motion of a moving particle is such that it passes through a 
definite point along the path of its motion in th e same direction in a definite interval of 
time, this type of motion is called periodic motion. This motion can be circular, elliptical 
or rectilinear. The motion of the hands of a clock, the motion of earth round the sun, the motion of piston in the cylinder of a steam or petrol engine etc.      
The time interval at which a particle of periodic motion passes through a definite point","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 33}"
94,"from the same direction repeatedly is called its time period.  
Vibratory motion : If a body executing periodic motion moves in a definite direction 
for one half of its time period and exactly for the other half in the opposite direction then","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 33}"
95,"30  Physics 
this motion is called vibratory motion. Motion of a simple pendulum, motion of 
vibrating tuning fork and the motion of string of guitar.   
2.3 Scalar and vector quantities :  
Anything that can be measured in this physi cal world is called a physical quantity. When 
a physical quantity is measured, it has got a magnitude. We express this magnitude in 
terms of a number and a unit. For example, if we say that the height of the bench is 1.5 
meter, we mean that the unit of length is meter and height of the bench is 1.5 times this unit. But all physical quantities cannot be completely expressed by its magnitude only. 
To express not only magnitude of some quantities is needed but also the direction.    
For example, if we say that a car is running at the speed of 40 km per hour, it is 
understood that the car moves a distance 40 km in one hour, but the direction of motion","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 34}"
96,"of the car cannot be known from this statement. To know the actual position of the car, the direction of the motion should also be stated. So, we can see, to express some of the 
quantities completely direction is needed with the magnitude of the quantities. In 
consideration of direction all quantities of the world we can divide into two category. Such as 
        1. In-directional quantity or Scalar quantity  
        2. Directional quantity or Vector quantity  
Scalar quantity : Physical quantities which can be fully expressed by magnitude only 
are called scalar quantities. Length, mass, speed, work, energy, time, temperature etc are 
the examples of scalar quantities.  
Vector quantity :  Physical quantity which need both magnitude and direction to be 
fully expressed are called vector quantities. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, electric intensity etc are the examples of vector quantities.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 34}"

Representation of a vector :  
A vector quality is represented by an arrow over the symbol of the physical quantity. For 
example, A or  A  , where   A   represents, the magnitude of the vector quantity   A. Sometimes bold A instead of A is used to represent a vector and an ordinary A to 
represent its magnitude. The vector quantities in the table 2.1 are represented by bold 
letter.        
In figure, a vector quantity represented by an arrow 
headed straight line. The length of the straight line 
represents the magnitude and the arrow head indicates the direction of the vector. For example, in 
figure 2.2 displacement of 50km has been 
represented by 1cm. Hence the vector A in this figure, whose length is 3cm represents a 
displacement of 150km towards west. The vector B 
represents a displacement of 100km towards north at an angle of 30
0 with the east.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 35}"
99,"0 with the east. 
2.4 Different quantities related to motion  Distance and Displacement: Suppose, Ovi ran 100m from his school gate. It is true that 
Ovi is 100m away from the gate, but it does not tell the 
exact position of Ovi. Because Ovi can be 100m away to the east, to the west, to the north, to the south or any other 
directions. To know exactly the change of position of Ovi, 
the direction towards which he moved 100m should also be known. If it is stated that Ovi ran 100m from the gate to the 
east then his exact position will be known definitely. If you 
go straight to the east from the gate you will find Ovi at a distance of 100m. The physical quantity which was first 
used to indicate the change of position of Ovi is  distance. This is a scalar quantity. In the 
second case, direction has also been mentioned along with distance, this is called displacement. This is a vector quantity. Change of position or distance in a definite","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 35}"
100,"direction is displacement. So, the change of position of an object with respect to its 
surrounding in a definite direction is called displacement. 
The minimum distance, that is, the linear distance between the initial and final position 
of a body is the magnitude of its displacement at its direction is towards final position 
from the initial position.  
The displacement does not depend on the path of the object. An object can move from 
position A to position B following different paths. But its displacement will be from A Fig-2.2 
Fig-2.3 W E
S N","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 35}"
101,"32  Physics 
towards B. The minimum distance between A and B, that is, in this case the linear 
distance AB is the magnitude of displacements. AB and its direction is towards B from 
A. Here, it is a vector quantity, since displacement has both magnitude and direction.     
The dimension of displacement is the same as that of distance.   Therefore, [ s ] = L  
The unit of displacement is the same as that of distance that is meter (m). The 
displacement of a body is 50m towards north means that the body has moved 50m from its initial position towards north direction.  
Speed :  Suppose in the previous example, Ovi takes 50 seconds, to travel 100m 
distance. If Mitu covers the same distance in 40 seconds, who goes faster ? Ovi or Mitu, definitely Mitu goes faster because she takes less time.   
Suppose, Ovi travels 100m in 50 seconds, Mitu travels 75m in 30 seconds can we say","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 36}"
102,"Ovi goes slower than Mitu ? Does not Ovi travel more distance than Mitu ? The distance of a particular time Ovi and Mitu travels has to be compared to know who goes faster. 
Let the particular time be 1 second therefore,  
In 1 second Ovi travels 100
50
  = 2 meter 
In 1 second Mitu travels 75
30 = 2.5 meter 
So, Mitu goes faster than Ovi because in 1 second Mitu travels more distance than Ovi.  
From the above discussion we can understand time and distance determines who goes 
faster.  
The quantity by which we can measure how fa st a body moves or distance traveled, is 
called speed. Speed expresses the rate of change position of a body. The rate of change 
of position of a body with time is called the speed.  
Speed of a body is measured by the distance traveled per unit time. i.e  
Speed = distance
time  
If a moving body travels a distance `d’ in time `t’ then the speed v is  
   The direction of rate of change of position of the body cannot be known by the speed. So","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 36}"
103,"it has no direction. Therefore, speed is a scalar quantity.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 36}"
104,"Physics  33 
The dimension of speed is the dimension of = distance
time   
∴ [ V ] = [ L / T ] = [ LT-1 ]  
As speed is obtained by the division of distance and time, unit of speed is obtained, by 
the division of units of distance and time.  
Since the unit of distance is meter (m) and unit of time is second (s), unit of speed is 
meter/second (ms-1). 
The speed of a body is 4ms-1 means that the body moves a distance of 4m in 1second.  
Though the unit of speed is meter/second, for our convenience sometimes we consider 
the unit of speed is kilometer/hour where the unit of distance is kilometer and of time is 
hour. The speedometer of car measures the speed in kmh-1 .  
Average Speed : If the magnitude of speed does not change during the motion of the 
body, that is if the body travels equal distance in equal interval of time, then the speed of 
the body is called uniform speed. And if the body does not travel equal distance in equal","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 37}"
105,"interval of time then the speed is called non uniform speed.  
If a body does not move with uniform speed, then the speed obtained by dividing the 
total distance traveled by time is called average speed.  
So, average speed =   total distance
time  
If a car runs 300 km in 6 hours since 7 in the morning on the way from Dhaka to 
Dinajpur, the average speed of the car is 300km/6h = 50kmh-1. Here, average speed 
50kmh-1 does not mean the car travels 50km in every hour rather it might travel 
sometimes faster or sometimes slower than the average speed.  
Instantaneous speed : If we want to know the instantaneous speed of any body at any 
instant, for example what was the speed of the car just the moment its 33miniutes travel 
is over, the speed of that moment will be the instantaneous speed. To find the 
instantaneous speed at any instant, the distance traveled at during a small interval, has to be known and then the distance has to be divided by the time interval.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 37}"
106,"If any one wants to the speed of the car at 10 : 32 : 43 am ( 10 hours 32 minute 43 
second) or at the time of cross over a speed breaker on the highway beside any school, 
he has to see the reading of the speedometer at the moment. Similarly with the help of Rudder or Laser gun we can know whether a car is violating the highest limit on the 
highway or the speed every ball of Mashrafi Bin Murtaja, the fastest bowler of 
Bangladesh national team.  
Velocity : Sometimes during usual conversation many people use the word velocity to 
mean speed. But in science the two words do  not mean the same thing speed indicates 
only the rate of change of position with time, it does not indicate the direction of change","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 37}"

 of position. The velocity states the rate of ch ange of position along with its direction that 
is, velocity means the rate of change of position in a definite direction or in other words 
the rate of change of displacement. Hence velocity of a body is its rate of change of 
displacement with time, that is the distance traveled by a moving body in unit time in a 
definite direction is called the velocity of the body.  
If a body travels a distance s in a definite direction in time t the velocity is v = 3
t   
The dimension of velocity is the same as that of speed, i.e [ LT-1 ]  
 The unit of velocity is ms-1 the same as that of 
speed. Velocity has both magnitude and direction. So, velocity is a vector quantity. A road may be 
taken as an example at some place the road has 
made a 30
0 angle with east and has gone straight 
towards north (Fig 2.4). On this road, if a car 
moves with a uniform speed of 20kmh-1 then we","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 38}"
108,"will be able to state correctly that the velocity of the car is 20 kmh
-1 towards north at an angle 300 
with east. But if the same car moves in a circular road with uniform speed of 20kmh
-1 than the 
direction of its motion will be continuously 
changed. So its velocity will also be changed continuously, although its speed will 
always remain the same. The magnitude of the velocity of a body is its speed. The specific directional speed is its velocity.    
If the magnitude and direction of the velocity of a moving body remains unchanged, then 
the velocity of the body as called uniform or equal velocity. The velocity of sound is a 
good example of natural phenomenon of uniform velocity. Sound travels in a definite direction over equal distances in equal intervals of time and it is 332ms

motion, then its velocity is called variable or uniform velocity. In other words if the body does not move through equal distance in equal intervals of time or changes its direction 
of motion while moving then its velocity will be variable. Usually we moving, car runs 
on the road etc. are the uniform velocity.  
Acceleration and Retardation : If a body does not move with uniform velocity then the 
magnitude or direction or both of the velocity may change. We say that there is 
acceleration of a body if its velocity changes. Suppose a car is moving along a straight Fig-2.4  N

seconds. The velocity of the car at different time in the units kmh-1 and ms-1 are shown 
in the following table.

From this table we can see that the velocity of the car increases from 0 to 4ms-1 in first 8 
second. In the next 8 seconds the velocity of the car increases by 4ms-1. In the way the 
velocity of the car increases by 4ms-1 in every 8 seconds. In other words the change of 
velocity of the car is 0.5ms-1. So, the rate of change of velocity of the car with time is 
0.5ms-1.   
The rate of change of velocity with time that is the change of velocity in unit time is 
known as acceleration. The rate of increase of velocity with time of a body moving in a","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 39}"
111,"straight line is called positive acceleration and the rate of decrease of velocity of a body 
with time is called negative acceleration. Sometimes negative acceleration is called retardation or deceleration.    
The rate of change of non-uniform velocity of a body with time is called its acceleration.  If the initial velocity of a body is u and its final velocity after time t is v.  
then change of velocity in time t = v – u  
Hence, change of velocity in unit time = v-u

∴ rate of change of velocity, i.e.

Therefore, acceleration = change of velocity

Acceleration is a vector quantity. It has direction. Its direction is along the change of 
velocity. Since we are considering the motion along a straight line, change of direction of velocity will be either along the direction of velocity or opposite to the velocity. If the 
velocity increases than the change of velocity takes place along the velocity. In this case","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 39}"

Unit : The unit of acceleration is the unit of velocity / time , that is, ms-1 / s = ms-2   
The acceleration of a body is 5ms-2 towards south means that the velocity of the body 
increases by 5ms-1 in 1 second towards south.  
Uniform acceleration and non-uniform acceleration :  Acceleration may be two types. Such as- uniform acceleration and non-uniform 
acceleration. If the rate of increase of velocity of a moving body in a particular direction","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 40}"
114,"is maintained constant all the time, then the acceleration is said to be uniform. Conversely, if the rate of increase of velocity changes with time, the acceleration is said 
to be non-uniform or variable.  
An example of uniform acceleration is the acceleration of a freely falling, body due to 
gravity the acceleration of a freely falling body is 9.8ms

by 9.8ms-1 for each successive seconds. That is, generally we see these moving body-

2.5 Equations of motion :  
We can solve the problems regarding motion of any moving bodies by using only four 
equations. These equations are called equation of motion. These equation are applicable when the object moves along straight line with uniform acceleration. Let a body with initial velocity u move with uniform acceleration a. Let the final velocity be v after 
traveling a distance s at time t.  
Let the initial velocity of a body be u moving with uniform acceleration a. After","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 41}"
117,"traveling a distance s in time t its final velocity becomes v. We express the equations of 
motion by the following symbols. These symbols are :   
u = initial velocity  
a = uniform acceleration  
t = traveled time  
s = displacement i.e. distance traveled in time t 
v = final velocity i.e. velocity after time t  
There are five quantities ``Suvat’’ are related in such a way that if we know the value of 
three, we can find the value of other two. So there are four equations and every equations has four quantities we can find the value of unknown quantities using the values known quantities by this equation.

2.6 Motion of falling bodies  
Gravity : Every particle of this universe attracts towards each other. The force of 
attraction between any two bodies or particles in this universe is called ``Gravitation’’. If 
earth is one of the two bodies, then the force of attractions is called gravity, that is, the 
attraction of the earth on any other body is called gravity. There is a law of Newton about this attraction between any two bodies of the universe is known as Newton’s law 
of gravitation.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 43}"
122,"of gravitation.  
We know from the Newton’s second law of motion that when a force acts on a body, it acts acceleration. So, acceleration of a body is produced due to the force of gravity as 
well. This acceleration is called acceleration due to gravity.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 43}"
123,"40  Physics 
The rate of increase of velocity of a freely falling body on earth due to force of gravity is 
called the acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration due to gravity is represented by 
the letter g.  
The quantities of magnitude of `g’ any place on earth is  
 
 
 Here, M = mass of the earth  
          G = a universal constant, which is called gravitational constant  
          R = Radius of the earth  
As the earth is not perfectly round, the polar regions are a bit compressed, therefore the 
radius of the earth R is not constant. Hence the values of `g’’ is not the same at all places 
on earth. The polar radius `R’ is the shortest and so the value of `g’ at the pole is the 
maximum. And the value of R is the longest at the equator. So the value of `g’ at the equation is the minimum. 
Since the value of `g’ is different at different places on the surface of the earth, its value 
at sea level altitude 45 ° is accepted as the standard value. This standard value of `g’ is","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 44}"
124,"9.80665ms-2. For convenience the standard valu e of `g’ is taken to be 9.8ms-2 or 9.81ms-2.   
Falling Bodies : If a body is dropped from a certain height, it falls on earth due to the 
influence of gravity. If a heavy and a light object are dropped from the same height 
simultaneously, will they reach the ground at the same time ?  
In fact, if a piece of stone and a piece of paper are dropped from the same height, it is 
seen that the stone reaches the ground first. Since the acceleration due to gravity does not dropped on the mass of the body, the acceleration of the stone and that of the paper 
would be the same. So they should reach at the same time on the earth, but due to the 
resistance of air two bodies reach at different time on the earth. If there is no resistance of the air, they would fall at the same time.  
Laws of falling bodies :  Galilio discovered three laws relating to falling bodies : These are called laws of","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 44}"
125,"falling bodies. These laws are applicable onl y for bodies falling from rest without any 
resistance. At the time of falling, the body will ``fall from rest, it will have no initial 
velocity. The body will fall freely without any resistance, that is, no force other than the 
gravitational force will act on the body. For example, the resistance due to air will not act on it.  
Laws of falling bodies are :  
First Law : All bodies falling from rest and from the same height without any resistance 
traverse equal distance in equal time.  
Second Law : The velocity (v), acquired by a freely falling body from rest in a given 
time (t) is directly proportional to time that is, v 
∝ t","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 44}"
126,"Physics  41 
Third Law : The distance (h) traversed by a freely falling body from rest in a given time 
(t) is directly proportional to the square of the time, that is, h ∝ t2.   
Equation of falling Body : Let a body be falling freely due to gravity with initial 
velocity u. The body attains a velocity v after time t. If the body falls through a distance 
h in that time and distance  s is replaced by h and acceleration a is replaced by accelerate 
on due to gravity g then the equations of falling body will be as following. 
v = u+gt 
h = (u+v)t

h = ut + 1
2 gt2 
v2 = u2 + 2gh 
Mathematical Example : 2.6 : A body drops from the roof of a building 50m high. 
With what velocity will it strike the ground.  
           g = 9.8ms-2    
We know, in case of falling bodies  
                         v2 =  u2 + 2gh    
                     or v2 =  0 + 2 x 9.8 ms-2 x 50m   
                             =  980m2s-2

2.7 Motion and Graph  
1. Distance-Time Graph : A moving object changes its position with the change of 
time. The distance traveled by the body depends on time. This relation can be 
represented graphically. In this case axis `X ’ in the graph represents time (t) and axis Y 
represent distance (s). This graph is called distance-time graph. We can find velocity easily by this graph. The methods of determining velocity from the distance-time graph for uniform and non-uniform velocities are discussed below. We will discuss the motion of an object moving only along straight line to avoid the complexities. So the velocity 
changes only for its magnitude.  
(A) In case of uniform Velocity: 
Suppose a pollution free CNG run auto-rickshaw is moving along plane straight road. 
The table below shows the distances traveled after every 12 minutes.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 45}"

For above mentioned motion in the table a distance-time graph shown in fig 2.5. 
Suppose from the graph we have to find the traveled distance in 32 minute by the auto-rickshaw; we have to mark a point (M) to indicate time, 32 minute on X-axis. Then we have to draw a line parallel to Y-axis from that point on the graph. Let the line at point P. Now draw a perpendicular on Y-axis from P. This perpendicular meets at point N on Y-axis. Therefore, ON is the distance traveled in 32 minutes. The graph shows that the auto-rickshaw travels 16km in this time. Therefore, from graph we find any traveled 
distance S = PM for any time t = OM. 
∴ Velocity = distance
time
    = PM
OM    = ON
OM , Here,  PM
OM is the slope of the OP. 
  
           
 
(B) In case of Non-uniform velocity : Fig 2.6 represents a distance-time graph of a","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 46}"
129,"body moving with non-uniform velocity. In this case the body does not move over equal distance in equal intervals of time, so the graph will not be a straight line. It will be a curved line. Since, the body is not moving with  uniform velocity, its velocity will not be 
the same at all instants during its motion. Suppose, the velocity of the body at a particular instant indicated by the point P in the curved line, is to be determined. To determine the velocity at the point P, we will have to consider a very small right angled triangle ABC. Its hypotenuse AB is so small Do by yourself :  Take a graph paper. Draw the distance-time graph on the graph paper using 
any convenient unit mentioned in the table above.  Find the distance traveled and velocity of 
the auto-rickshaw in 32 minutes from the graph. What will be the distance traveled and 
velocit y in 44 minutes.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 46}"
130,"Physics  43 
that it virtually consider with the curved line adjacent to point P. In other words we are 
considering a part of the curved line which is so small that it may be considered a 
straight line.  
Then the velocity at the point P = distant represented by AC
 time interval represented by BC 
or v =   AC
BC 
But it is difficult to get correct result by measuring such a small triangle. So we draw a 
tangent ED at the point P and draw a greater triangle DEF similar to ABC.  
Now from the triangles ABC and DEF We get,  AC
BC   = DF
EF  
∴ v = DF
EF  
But,    DF
EF  is the slope of ED 
Therefore, the velocity at the point P is the slope or gradient of the tangent drawn at that 
point. Thus it may be said that the gradient of the tangent at any point on the distance-
time graph represents the velocity at that point.  
2. Velocity – time graph  
The velocity of an object moving with non-uniform velocity depends on time. This","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 47}"
131,"relation can be expressed by a graph. In this case time (t) is plotted along X-axis and velocity (v) along Y-axis. This graph is called velocity-time graph. We can find velocity and acceleration i.e. the rate of change of velocity with time from the graph easily. The method of finding acceleration from velocity-time graph in case uniform acceleration is 
discussed below.  
In case of uniform acceleration : When a body moves with uniform acceleration, its 
velocity increases equally for equal intervals of time. Hence the velocity-time graph will be a straight line (fig 2.7). Now let us take a point P on this graph and draw a normal PM on the X-axis from P. Then the change of velocity PM for any time interval of OM is 
obtained.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 47}"

So it is said that the slope of tangent drawn at any point on velocity-time graph

3.1 Inertia and qualitative concep t of force- Newton’s first law 
We have already known about rest, motion, displacement, velocity, acceleration etc. We 
can see different types of objects around us. Some of them are in rest and some of them 
are in motion. Among the bodies in rest, there are chair, table, houses, log of wood etc. 
Can a body in rest move itself? Tonight your reading table is in a certain place. Will it be in the same place in the next morning? What do we observe from these practical 
experiences? It is observed that the bodies at rest are still at rest. These bodies can’t 
move by themselves. Suppose that one of your friends is riding a bi-cycle on a plane road. At any moment he stopped paddling the cycle. Will the cycle stop at once? We 
find that the cycle will stop slowly after crossing a small distance. Would the cycle move 
continuously if there is no air resistance and friction?","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 53}"
144,"From this evidence we can understand that everybody has the tendency to remain in the 
same state as it is. If the body is at rest it continues to be at rest. On the other hand if the 
body is in motion it continues to be in motion. This tendency or property of a body to 
maintain its own state is called inertia. Thus  the tendency of a body to maintain its own 
state for ever in which the body is at present or the property of a body to preserve that 
state is defined as inertia.  
The inertia of a body depends on its mass. That is, mass is the measure of its inertia. The 
more the mass, the more the inertia of a body. In other words, it is difficult to move, increase or decrease velocity or change the di rection of velocity of a body whose inertia 
is large.  
Do yourself 
• Keep a pen and a book on a table. Now st rike the pen with finger. What do you 
observe? The pen moved a small distance on the table.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 53}"
145,"• Now repeat this procedure for the book. The book won’t move. Now push the book 
with your hand. The book will be displaced from its original position.  
Between the pen and the book, it needs more effort to move the book as the mass i.e. the 
inertia of the book is greater. 
Example of inertia 
If a bus at rest suddenly starts moving the passengers lean backwards. The reason behind 
this is inertia. When the bus is at rest, the bodies of the passengers are also at rest. When 
the bus starts moving, the part of the passenger’s body attached to the bus also moves 
with it. But the upper part of the body tends to remain stationary due to inertia of rest. 
Thus the upper part of the body lags behind with respect to the lower part. As a result the passenger inclines backwards. On the other hand, when a sudden brake is applied in a 
moving bus the passengers lean forwards. When a bus is in motion, the passenger of the","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 53}"
146,"bus is also in the same speed of the bus. When the bus stops suddenly, the lower part of","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 53}"
147,"50  Physics 
the body also becomes stationary with the bus. But the upper part of the passenger’s 
body moves forward due to inertia of motion. 
During car driving the drivers wear seat belt for safety. What is the reason? The reason 
behind this is inertia. If he doesn’t use seat belt, he would lean forward due to inertia of 
motion for applying fast brake. For this reason he would hit the steering and other bodies in front of him, for this a serious accident may happen. Not only have the drivers, the 
passengers also had to wear the seat belt if there is an arrangement of seat belt in the car. 
We have a general concept about force from our daily life experiences. When we pull or 
push a body, then we say a force is applied upon the body. This applied force can create or tends to create motion in a stationary body. If the body is in motion, then the applied 
force can cease the motion of the body or trie s to increase its velocity. In both cases to","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 54}"
148,"apply force, it needs direct contact between the force applier and the body. These types of force are known as contact force. If the two bodies are not in direct contact, still they 
can apply force on each other. Such a well- known force is the force of gravitation, 
whose practical example is the weight of a body. When a body falls from your hand, then it quickly touches the ground. What is the reason? It happens due to the weight or 
attraction of the earth on the body. We define this force as the force of gravitation. In 
this way we feel the existence of different type of forces in different events of nature. 
For example- the magnetic force between two poles of a magnet, the electrical force 
between two charged bodies, nuclear force within the nucleus. 
Now we will see how we can get concept about inertia and force from Newton’s first 
law of motion. Newton’s first law of motion is- 
‘Every object will continue in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 54}"
149,"unless an external force is applied to it.’ 
Newton’s first law expresses the property of inertia of matter. From Newton’s first law of motion we observe that a body cannot change its state on its 
own. If the body is at rest, it tends to remain at rest forever and if it is in motion it tends to keep on motion with uniform speed for all time. This property of a body is termed as 
inertia. Thus from the Newton’s first law of motion we get the concept of inertia. 
Again from Newton’s first law we see that to change the state of a body something 
external must be applied. That is, the external cause which changes or tends to change 
the state of an object is called force. Thus from Newton’s first law we get qualitative definition of force. According to Newton’s first law, a force is that which acting on a 
body at rest produces or tends to produce motion or acting on a moving body changes or 
tends to change its state of motion.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 54}"

3.2 Nature of force 
Contact force: 
We are familiar with different types of force in our daily lives. Nature of them is of 
different types. Some of them are produced due to direct contact between two bodies.  In addition, there are some forces which do not need direct contact between two bodies. 
The force which needs direct contact between two bodies to be created is defined as 
contact force. When we push or pull a body with hand our hand exerts a force on the body at that time. This push or pull force is  contact force. Since this force is the 
consequence of the direct contact between the hand and the body. The examples of 
contact forces are- frictional force, pulling force and the force created during collision.  
When a body tends to move or move over another body, then a resistive frictional force","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 55}"
151,"is produced against the motion between the contact surfaces of two bodies. Here the frictional force is produced due to direct c ontact between the surfaces of the two bodies. 
We apply pulling force on a box when we pull it over the floor. At that time frictional 
force is produced opposite to the motion of the box. 
Non-Contact force: 
The force which acts without direct contact between two bodies is called non-contact force. The attractive gravitational force betw een two bodies, the attractive or repulsive 
electric force between two charged bodies, th e attractive or repulsive force between two 
poles of two magnets, the force of attrac tion acting between a magnet and a magnetic 
material are the examples of non-contact force or distant force.

152,"pulling?  Here, the earth is pulling the body towards it, though there is no direct 
connection between the body and the earth i.e. the earth is not in contact with the body. 
Here the earth is applying force of gravitation on the body. The force of gravitation is a non-contact force. Any two body of the univers e exert force of gravitation on each other. 
When the earth exerts force of gravitation on another body, then this force is called 
gravity. 
Though we observe different kinds of force in nature, fundamental force are of four 
types. Rest of them is some forms of these fundamental forces. The forces which are root or independent i.e. the forces which are not produced from some other forces or not any 
forms of some other forces are called fundamental forces. Instead, other forces are some 
forms of these fundamental forces.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 55}"
153,"52  Physics 
The four fundamental forces which exist in nature are: 
1. Force of gravitation 
2. Electromagnetic force 
3. Weak nuclear force 
4. Strong nuclear force 
Force of Gravitation: 
In this universe every body attracts each other by a force towards them. The mutual 
attraction between any two bodies of the universe is called gravitation. This attraction occurs due to mass of the bodies. The force of gravitation is comparatively weak among the fundamental forces. Weight of us is the consequence of gravitation. The planets of the solar system are revolving round the Sun due to force of gravitation. The range of 
gravitation extends to infinity. 
Electromagnetic force: 
The electromagnetic force is defined as the force exerted by two charged particles or 
bodies on each other due to their charges. Th is force may be of both types- attractive or","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 56}"
154,"repulsive. When the charged particles are at rest, only electric force works between them. The magnetic force is created simultaneously in addition to the electric force between the particles when the charged particles are mobile. The force of attraction or repulsion between two magnetic poles is also electromagnetic force. The electric force acting between two charged fundamental particles is more powerful than the force of gravitation between them. Nevertheless, electric force is of medium type considering strength. Frictional force, spring force etc. are produced due to electric forces between 
the charged particles.  
 Weak nuclear force 
The short range and small magnitude force that exists between the fundamental particles 
within the nucleus is called weak nuclear fo rce. Due to this force the nucleus becomes 
unstable and beta decay occurs. Most of the radioactive disintegration occurs due to 
weak nuclear force. The range of this force is less than 10
-16 m.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 56}"
155,"-16 m. 
Strong nuclear force 
It is known that there are two particles namely proton and neutron within the nucleus of 
an atom. These particles are called nucleon. The strong force that exists between two nucleons within the nucleus of an atom is called strong nuclear force. This force bounds the nucleons together. The strong nuclear force is responsible for the stability of the nucleus. This force is very short range and attractive. The range of this force is 10
-15 m 
which is the radius of the nucleus. This force is the strongest among the fundamental 
forces.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 56}"
156,"Physics  53 
3.3 Balanced and unbalanced forces 
When two or more forces acting on an object produce zero resultant force, i.e. the object 
has no acceleration; we say that the forces are balanced. The forces that produce this 
balanced condition are called balanced forces.  
It is seen in figure 3.1 that an object is suspended 
with a thread. The force of attraction of earth on the object i.e. the weight of the object W is acting 
vertically downward. The tension of the thread T is 
acting vertically upward. Here the two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction thus 
canceling each other’s action and producing a 
balanced condition.  
Only the attractive force of the earth i.e. the force of 
gravity will act on the object if the thread is cut. Then the object will fall down with acceleration due 
to gravity. Here, the force of gravity or weight of the 
object is the unbalanced force. If the body is displaced slightly along one side, the tension of the","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 57}"
157,"thread T and the weight W will not be in a straight 
line. Then a resultant force will act on the body without creating balanced condition. Due to this, the 
body will oscillate. This is an example of unbalanced 
force. 
Another example of balanced and unbalanced forces 
can be seen in the game of tug-of-war competition. In this game, a handkerchief is tied to the center of the rope. In this competition equal 
numbers of competitors pull on the rope in two sides and try to move the handkerchief to 
their side. If the handkerchief does not move then it is understood that either the team are applying equal amount of force and the rope or the handkerchief is in balanced 
condition. Here, forces applied by the two teams are balanced forces.  
If one team applies more force than the other, then the resultant force will act along them 
thus creating unbalanced force and the handkerchief will move to their side. Then this team will be declared as the winning team in the competition.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 57}"

3.4 Momentum 
The physical quantity which is produced by the combination of mass and velocity of a 
moving body is the momentum. Momentum depends on the mass and velocity of the body. Think about a loaded truck and a private car. You have to stop both the cars within the same distance. Which car needs hard brake to stop? The answer is truck. Though the truck and the car are moving with the same speed, the truck possesses that physical quantity which is more is its momentum.  
Momentum is a measure of how difficult it is to stop something that is moving. 
Momentum is related to the force. This relation is obtained quantitatively in Newton’s second law of motion.  
Momentum is the product of the mass and velocity of a moving body.  Let, the mass of a body
m=  
    Velocity =  v 
            ∴ Momentum = mv                                   (3.1) 
Momentum is a vector quantity. Its direction is in the direction of velocity. It is observed","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 58}"
160,"from equation (3.1) that the momentum of a body will be large if the body has a large mass and moving faster. 
Unit: the unit of momentum is, unit of mass × unit of velocity, i.e. 
-1kg×ms  or -1kg ms . 
If a body of 1 kg moves with a velocity of 1ms-1, its momentum will be 1kg ms-1. 
Dimension:  The dimension of momentum:  [p] = MLT-1.  
3.5 Effect of force on motion 
A force can cause a stationary object to start moving. 
What happens when a stationary football is kicked by a player? It is seen that the ball 
moves off in the direction it is kicked from its stationary state. In this case the ball accelerates from rest. Here acceleration is positive,  and in the same direction as the force 
exerted by the kick. 
A force can cause a moving object to increase its velocity. 
What would be the velocity when a cricke t ball is hit by the batsman in the same","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 58}"
161,"direction as the ball moves? It is observed that the ball moves faster after the hit. In this case the acceleration is positive and its veloc ity increases. The velocity of a moving 
marble increases if it is stroked in same direction as it moves.  
A force can cause a moving object to decrease speed. 
Think you are riding a bicycle in the village road. After a while you observed that the 
road is slanting downwards. Now what will you do? Will you continue the pedaling as","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 58}"
162,"Physics  55 
before or give a brake? You have to apply brake to cross this sloping road safely. Due to 
this, the cycle decelerates.  
A force can cause a moving object to chan ge its velocity or direction of motion. 
A batsman hits the cricket ball coming from opposite direction during a game of cricket. 
Due to the hit, the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the ball change. The ball moves in a different direction due to this hit by the bat. In this case too, the ball has 
acceleration.  
Effect of forces on shape  
There are many examples around us where the shape of a body changes by the 
application of force. The shape of an empty plastic bottle changes when it is pressed. Again when a rubber band is stretched by pulling it, it becomes narrow and its shape 
changes.  
Sometimes, the changes of shape of the bodies are temporary in nature. Sometimes, the 
shape of the object is permanently changed due to the application of force. Such changes","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 59}"
163,"occur in the crushed metallic can or a car after a collision.  
A temporary change of shape may provide a useful way of absorbing and storing energy. 
Compressing the spring by rotation of the key th e potential energy is stored in a toy car. 
When the car is released the potential en ergy is transformed into kinetic energy. A 
permanent change of shape may mean the failure of a structure- as a bridge collapse due 
to excess load. 
3.6 Relation between force and acceleration- Newton’s second law 
Newton’s first law gives qualitative definition of force. Newton’s second law gives the 
equation for the measurement of force. From Newton’s second law we know the relationship between the force acting on a body and the acceleration produced due to this 
force. The law is as follows: 
The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force acting on 
it and takes place in the direction in which the force acts.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 59}"
164,"Let a body of mass m is moving with an initial velocity u. Now a constant force F acts 
on the body for a time t in the direction of its velocity. Let the velocity of the body 
changed from u to v due to the application of the force.  
Therefore,  
              ∴ the initial momentum of the body = 
mu  
              ∴ the final momentum of the body   = mv  
               The change of momentum in time t  = mv mu−","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 59}"

According to Newton’s second law of motion, the rate of change of momentum is 
proportional to the applied force.  i.e.,

           kF=                                                                                                                  (3.2)  
Here, k is a constant of proportionality. To define the unit of force Newton consider k=1. 
The unit of force is Newton (N). One newton  (N) is defined as the force that will 
produce an acceleration of 1ms-2 when it acts on a mass of 1 kg. 
Thus if mass m is in kg, acceleration a is in ms-2, and force F is in N, then equation (3.2) 
becomes, 
1. ma F=

3.7 Action and reaction force- Newton’s third law 
Whenever a force acts on one body, at that time an equal and opposite force acts on 
some other body. This matter is generally stated as- 
To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. 
This statement is known as Newton’s third law of motion. 
Therefore, according to Newton’s third law, the values of the action and reaction forces 
are same but their directions are opposite to each other. In figure 3.5 if the object P exerts a force F
1 on the object Q, then according to this law, the object Q will also exert 
an equal and opposite force F 2 on the object P. The force exerted by the object P on 
object Q is called action force and the force exerted by Q on P is called reaction force.  
 
Figure 3.5 
Therefore, according to Newton’s third law, F1 = - F 2 
It is noticeable that the action and reaction force act on different bodies. The reaction 
force will exist as long as the there is action.

168,"Example: 
Walking on road 
In our daily life we walk or run on the ground [Figure 3.6]. When we walk on the 
ground, we exert a backward force on the ground by the leg behind obliquely. This is the action force. According to the third law a reaction force is produced opposite to this. We are able to walk on the road due to this reaction force.

Firing by a gun 
When a person fire with a gun, he feels a backward push at that time. What is the reason 
behind this? In this case, action and reaction force of bullet and gun exists for the same time. According to the Newton’s second law of motion, the bullet and the gun acquire 
equal and opposite momentum. As a result the bullet moves forward with a particular 
momentum and the gun moves backward with a momentum of same magnitude but opposite in direction. Due to this, the person will feel a backward thrust. The backward 
velocity of the gun will be smaller in comparison to that of the bullet as the mass of the 
gun is large. 
Collision 
Among you, those who have played marble probably had seen how one marble hits 
another marble. In addition, you are familiar with different types of road accident through newspapers or television. These events are the practical examples of collision.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 62}"
170,"Therefore, when a moving object hits another body at rest or in motion, then it is said 
that a collision has taken place. During collision a force acts on each of the two bodies. 
If the force exerted by the first body on the second body is called action force, then the force exerted by the second body on the first one is called the reaction force. These two 
forces acting during collision are same in magnitude but opposite in direction. No other 
external force acts during the collision except the action and reaction force. From Newton’s second law we get, 
mv muFt−=  
We can express the change of momentum from this equation as- 
                                    F t mv mu×=−                                         (3.4)  
i.e.  force × time = change of momentum. 
The product of force and time is defined as impulse of force. Therefore, impulse of force = change of momentum

1 and m 2 are moving with velocities u 1 and u 2","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 62}"
171,"respectively along a straight line. If the velocity of A is greater than that of B, at any time the object A will collide with the object B [Figure 3.7].  The force exerted on B by 
A is the action F
1. The object B will also exert a force F 2 on A, this F 2 is the reaction 
force. According to Newton’s third law of motion, 12FF=−

172,"Physics  59 
During collision, the action and reaction force exists for the same time. Let the time 
duration of action and reaction be t. After the collision the two objects will continue to 
move along the same straight line with their changed velocities. Let v1 and v2 be the 
changed velocities of A and B respectively. If due to action and reaction, the accelerations of A and B are a
1 and a2 respectively, then

Therefore, the sum of the momentum of the objects A and B remains same before and 
after the collision. It is the law of conservation of momentum.

3.8 Safe journey: force and motion 
To control the speed of car is an important issue for a safe journey. We travel in a car to 
meet the necessity of our daily lives. We use different vehicles during the journey. Sometimes in bus or train or we use personal vehicles. The speed of a vehicle and force 
is inseparably related to each other during the journey in such vehicles. The speed of a 
car plays a vital role for a safe journey. The speed or velocity would not be such that which is not controllable. To travel in a dist ant destination, it is necessary to know about 
the road condition and environment.  
The driver has to check the car well before start journey. As an example, whether the 
tyre or brake is perfectly right or not. He has to ensure whether the engine, used battery, 
front and rear lamps, wiper, and signal lights of two sides are right and properly working. In addition, he has to properly adjust the mirrors used in the car.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 64}"
176,"At first the driver and the passengers will w ear the seat belt during driving time. It is 
observed that most of the road accidents occu r due to very fast driving. So, the driver 
must be cautious to control the speed of the car. The kinetic energy becomes more due to 
increased speed.  For example- if the velocity of the car is doubled, its kinetic energy is increased by four times in comparison to th at of the earlier value. If the velocity is 
increased by three times, kinetic energy is increased by nine times. Then it becomes 
difficult to reduce or to control the velocity and the accident becomes terrible.  
Drivers are advised to choose a vehicle which th ey are used to driving earlier. It is not 
wise to try to drive a new vehicle suddenly. It is observed that the youth try to drive a new car emotionally. It’s not proper at all. Slow down the vehicle’s speed when you 
meet other vehicles from opposite direction. To obey the traffic sign and traffic law is","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 64}"
177,"the citizen responsibility of the vehicle driv er. The driver should concentrate on driving 
absolutely during driving.  
3.9 Friction and force of friction We are familiar with friction in various ways in our daily lives. From Newton’s first law 
of motion we know that if no force acts on a body the body will continue in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. Does it actually happen in reality? Take a 
marble and roll it on the floor. When you roll the marble, you apply a force on it. As a 
result, the marble becomes mobile on the ground. According to Newton’s law the marble should remain in uniform velocity. In practice, it is seen that the marble comes to rest 
after traversing a small distance. This happens due to the friction of the floor. When the 
marble is in motion on the floor, a frictional force is developed due to the mutual friction between the marble and the floor. This force acts in the direction opposite to the motion","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 64}"
178,"and hinders the motion. If the friction of the floor was absent, then the marble would 
continue its perpetual motion with uniform velocity.  When a body moves or tends to move over another body, then a resistance is developed 
between the two surfaces in contact, which is known as friction. This resistive force is 
called frictional force.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 64}"
179,"Physics  61 
The frictional force always acts opposite to the motion and obstructs the motion. 
Origin of friction 
Whenever the surface of an object slides over the surface of another object, each object 
exerts a frictional force on the other. The que stion arises- why friction occur? Friction is 
the result of the surface irregularities of any two surfaces. Each object has a surface. 
Again, the surface may be smooth or rough. Apparently, the surface of an object seems to be smooth, but it is observed that there are high and low grooves on it when viewed 
by a microscope [Figure 3.8]. When an object moves on another object, then the grooves 
of the two surfaces in contact catch onto one another. As a result of which the motion of one surface over another surface gets obstacled.  
As the grooves of a surface deepend and their number increases i.e. as the surface 
become rougher, the motion of one surface over another becomes more obstructed. Then","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 65}"
180,"the magnitude of frictional force also increases. The body becomes mobile if it can 
overcome the resistance of the surface in contact. The frictional force causes the object to slow down and stop thereby.  
 
Figure: 3.8 
Types of friction 
Generally there are four types of friction.  
1. Static friction 
2. Sliding friction 
3. Rolling friction 
4. Fluid friction 
Static friction Static friction is the friction between two surfaces that aren't moving relatively to each 
other.  
When a force is applied to an object, but it does not cause it to move, then static friction 
works. When a massive body on a floor is pulled by a force but it does not move, then the frictional force created is called force of static friction. The static frictional force is 
developed opposite to the applied force and acts until motion is produced. 
When two bodies at rest are in contact with one another and one body is made to move","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 65}"
181,"on the other body, the friction produced between them until a relative motion is created 
is called static friction.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 65}"
182,"62  Physics 
Sliding friction 
Sliding friction is friction where an object slides, or rubs against, another surface.  
We fall down and traverse a small distance when we move in a slippery road. When a 
hard brake is applied on a car moving fast, the car does not stop rather cross a small 
distance by sliding. 
Rolling friction 
Rolling friction is friction between a rolling object and the surface that it is rolling on.  
The wheel’s motion of a cycle, motion of marble is example of rolling friction.    During 
travelling we use luggage carrier having wheels to carry goods. If there was no wheel in the luggage carrier then it was too difficult to pull it by sliding from one place to another. Due to the attachment of wheel it becomes easier to pull it i.e. the force of 
rolling friction is less than that of the static friction.  
Fluid friction 
When an object moves in a fluid i.e. a liquid or gas, the friction acts is called fluid 
friction.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 66}"
183,"friction.  
We have to overcome a barrier in water while swimming in the pond. This barrier is the 
fluid friction. A parachute works by harnessing the air resistance. The air resistance is a 
type of frictional force which works against the force of gravity of the earth. As an open parachute has a large surface area, it helps provide enough air resistance. As a result, the sky-diver’s falling speed is decreased mostly . So, the skydiver will then be able to 
descend slowly and safely.  
3.10 Effects of friction on motion 
Friction has enormous influence on the motion of an object. Friction is 
a kind of resistive force which slows down the motion of a body. Though friction creates many problems in our daily lives, it plays a 
vital role for movement and vehicle operaration. In this section we 
shall discuss about tyre’s surface, smoothness of road and role of friction for controlling motion. 
Tyre’s surface","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 66}"
184,"Tyre’s surface 
Driving vehicles is possible because of the friction between the tyres and the road 
surface. The friction force between the tyres and the road depends on condition of the 
tyres and surface of the road. It also depends on the weight of the vehicle. The tyre’s 
rubber surface is designed with treads i.e. grooves or teeth. The tyre surface is up and 
down due to these grooves. If the tyre is new, these grooves are distinct; as a result the 
force of friction between the tyre and the road is maximum. When the tyre becomes old, Figure: 3.9","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 66}"
185,"Physics  63 
their grooves are worn out and the surface becomes flat. As a result the frictional force 
between the tyre and the road decreased mostly. Say, what inconvenience may arise due 
to this.  
Smoothness of road 
The smoothness of road has a great impact on the motion of a body. When the road is 
smooth, movement of vehicles on the road becomes easier and the journey becomes comfortable. As the road becomes smoother, the resistive force of friction becomes 
lesser. The magnitude of the frictional force between the car’s tyre and the road depends 
on the smoothness of the tyre as well as on the smoothness of the road. Many types of problems arise when amount of the frictional force is decreased largely. So, the road 
should not be too smooth. If the road is too smooth, it is not possible to stop the car","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 67}"
186,"within a certain distance in spite of applying brake. The friction is important for the motion of a car. If the road is too smooth, the necessary reaction force is not produced. 
The amount of the frictional force is largely reduced when the road is too smooth, as a 
result the car will not be able to move forward. So, the smoothness of the road will be such that it can supply the necessary frictional force. 
Controlling motion and braking force 
The speed of the vehicle has to increase or decrease according to the necessity at the 
time of vehicle movement. That is, we have to control the motion of a vehicle.  
Brake is such an arrangement, which controls the speed of the car or rotation of the 
wheels according to the necessity by increasing the friction. With this it is possible to 
halt a vehicle in a certain place. When the dr iver applies the brakes, the shoe or pad 
made of asbestos press the metallic disc on the wheel. The friction between the pad and","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 67}"
187,"disc slows down the wheel’s speed. As a result, the velocity of a car decreases.      
3.11 Increasing and decreasing friction 
Friction is inextricably related to our daily lives. Friction can be increased in necessity; 
again friction can be decreased too in necessity. How friction can be decrease and increase would be discussed in this section. 
Reducing friction 
Smoothing the surface 
Friction  makes many troubles to displace one body from one place to another. Let, you 
want to displace a massive box on the floor. If the friction of the contact surface is large 
enough, then it takes a lot of labor to displace it. By polishing or smoothing the surface it can be decreased.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 67}"
188,"64  Physics 
Using wheels 
There are wheels in bus, truck and many types of machinery. The wheel is an ingenious 
invention. Its circular shape reduces friction to a minimum. Without wheel was it possible to use this machinery?  Using wheel  in a suitcase reduces the friction and it 
becomes easier to pull it. The value of the rolling friction in comparison to the sliding 
friction is reduced greatly due to the attachment of wheels.  
Using lubricants 
Oil, mobil and grease like materials are called lubricants or greasy materials in short. A 
layer of lubricant between the two surfaces can greatly reduce the friction. So, lubricants are used between the moving parts of an engine. In addition, we use oil in sewing 
machine, lock and hinges.  
Using ball bearings  
Another important invention similar to the wheel is the invention of ball bearing. It was","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 68}"
189,"possible to reduce the friction greatly between the surfaces by using ball bearing. Ball bearings are the small, smooth metal balls. Generally these are made of steel. Ball bearings are placed between the moving parts of a machine. They roll around so that the moving parts of the machine do not rub against each other directly. That is, the surfaces roll over one another instead of sliding and friction reduces. There are uses of ball 
bearing in car’s wheel, cycle and electric fan [Figure 3.10].  
 
Figure 3.10 
Increasing friction 
Driving cars 
Without friction in the road, the tyres of a car will just spin around at the same spot.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 68}"
190,"Possibly you have seen how truck and bus is blocked in a slippery or muddy road in the rainy days. What is the reason behind this? This is due to the large decrease in friction. So friction is to be increased according to the necessity. The car tyres are so designed that they are able to grip the road properly and create necessary frictional force. Therefore the surface of the tyres are designed with treads i.e. grooves and teeth.  In the rainy days, the water or mud enters the grooves and water and mud are thrown outside 
boldly. As a result, the tyres are able to grip the road surface well.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 68}"
191,"Physics  65 
i.e. friction can be increased by making the surface rough.  
Mountain climbing 
Mountain climbers need to grip the rock or mountain surface with their hands and feet, 
in order to climb a mountain. They use chalk powder to grip the rock. 
There are spikes under the boot of players so that they do not fall down while running. 3.12 Friction: a necessary evil 
 Though friction has many disadvantages it is considered as a necessary evil. What 
causes it?  We cannot do anything without the force of friction. If there was no friction, the motion of a body would not cease at all a nd continue perpetually. Due to friction, a","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 69}"
192,"nail is fixed in a wall. It became possible to construct buildings and houses because of friction. Friction has made it possible to write on a paper with a pencil or a pen. We can walk as there is a friction between our shoes and the ground. We can change the direction of motion of a car owing to friction. Using a parachute it is possible to descend safely to the ground by harnessing the air resistance. In spite of having so many advantages we have to suffer a lot for friction. Because of excess friction the vehicles cannot move easily. Any device that has moving parts can wear out and tear due to friction. In any type of vehicles- may be car, boat or airplane, extra fuel has to be spent 
to overcome the excess friction. Fuel energy is being wasted because of friction. 
The energy that is wasted for friction mainly appears as heat energy. Not only that","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 69}"
193,"energy is converted to heat due to friction, but also the parts of an engine may be overheated.  As a result of friction, the soles of your shoes wear and tear out. So to make the life and works easier we need friction but excess friction is the cause of many losses too. Therefore to produce the necessary friction, we have to control it. Sometimes we need to increase or decrease friction by some processes. Therefore, we cannot discard friction totally; also friction is beneficial to  us in many cases. For this reason friction is 
called a necessary evil.

WORK, POWER AND ENERGY 
 
 
[By work we mean to do something in our ev eryday life. But in physics it refers to a 
specific concept. In the beginning of this chapter we will present this concept. The most important topic in science is energy. From our experience we see that the world becomes inactive without energy. We get energy in different forms. Such as kinetic energy for motion, potential energy for object in higher position from the ground, the energy of spring at contract condition or expanding condition, heat energy of hot body, electrical energy of charged body etc. The energy is transforming from one form to another gradually although the total energy of the universe remains unchanged and constant. In this chapter we will discuss about the transformation of energy and the law of 
conservation of energy, one of the important laws of science.]

4.1 Work: 
Work means to do something in our everyday life but in science doing anything is not 
work. In science the term work represents a definite concept. A gateman guards a house all day long sitting at a place and can say he has done his work. A boat was floating with","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 73}"
202,"the current of a river or canal and Mr. Karim was pulling it back. He might say he has done work to hold the boat otherwise the current of the river could pull it away. These are recognized as work in our daily life but these are not work in the point of view of science. Rather had the gateman guarded the house walking instead of sitting or had the boat floated with the current of the river, work could have been done. The concept of work in science is different from that of daily life. In fact in science work is done when displacement is associated with force. So, if a force acts on a body and causes its displacement only then work is said to be done. We see many examples of work around us in our daily life. For example, bull pulls the plough; a laborer pushes forward a push 
cart, someone throws iron sphere is sports competition etc.

the above examples (b) and (c) work is done but in the example (a) and (d) no work is done. We can apply force to shift a body from one place to another. We can change the 
shape of any body by applying force. In these cases work is done. 
If a construction laborer wants to get to the second floor of a building with ten bricks, he 
has to do more work than that of lifting a single brick to the same place as he has to use more force. He has to do more work if he wants to lift those brick on the third floor. Therefore, the amount of work depends on the applied force and the distance. Work is measured by the product of applied force on a body and its displacement along the 
direction of force. Therefore,","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 73}"

If a force of 1N is applied on a body and the body gets a displacement of 1m along the direction of force then the work done is said to be 1joule (1J), i.e. 1J = 1Nm. If the displacement takes place along the direction of force then work done is said to be work done by the force. If a duster falls on a floor from a table the work is done here by the force of gravity. If the displacement of a body takes place opposite to the direction of force then the work done is called work done against force. If a duster is lifted on the top of a table from the floor then the work is done against the force of gravity. This is because the displacement takes place opposite to the direction of the force of gravity.

4.2 Energy 
Nothing can move or work without energy. We need energy for our survival. The 
amount of work we do everyday depends on our energy level. We get energy from the food we take. Plants need energy for growth. Engine also needs energy for its functioning. Some engines use electricity and some need fuel for energy. Energy is stored in fuel. What do we mean by energy? The energy of a body means its ability to work.

When we say a body has energy in it we m ean the body can apply force on other and can

The energy of a body refers to its ability to work. Here work means the transformation of 
energy from one form to another. It means that the total amount of work that a body can 
do is its energy. The amount of work a body can do is the measure of its energy. So, the 
amount of work done is the amount of energy used.

From the above example we can see energy exists in the body in motion. The capacity of 
doing work acquired by a moving body due to its motion is called kinetic energy.

pen. Hit the pen by your finger towards the object. 
Why does the object displace from its initial pos ition? This is because the hit makes the 
pen move and the pen obtains the ability to work that is kinetic energy is produced in it. So it could displace the object.

Potential Energy: 
If a piece of stone or brick falls on a body from the roof of a building it may flatten or break the body. When the stone or brick was in rest on the roof potential energy was stored in it but the potential energy works when it falls down. The energy was stored in 
the stone because it was above the ground.  
What will happen when the two ends of a spring is stretched and tied to two objects and 
then released? The objects will move fast and collide with each other. The stretched 
spring was at rest but potential energy was there in it. If it is released it may work. The 
energy was stored in the stretched spring because it was strained. 
The ability of a body to do work when its nor mal position or configuration is changed to 
some other position or configuration is called potential energy.

If some work is done against the force at the time of changing from normal position or configuration to some other position or configuration then the body obtains the capacity of doing work that is same amount of energy is stored in it. This principle is applicable within the sphere of in fluence of conservative force such 
as electric force, magnetic force, spring force etc. This sphere of influence is called the field of that force such as gravitational field, electric field etc. We work against the force of gravity when we lift anything higher from the ground.

Potential energy depends on the vertical he ight of the object from the surface of the 
earth. The more is the height, the higher will be the potential energy. Potential energy also depends on the mass of the object. The more the mass the more will be the potential energy of the object.

of energy. For example, a piece of stone is not  dangerous as long as it is on the roof and

The modern mechanized civilization cannot proceed a moment without energy. Work is 
available at the expense of energy. Uninterrupted energy supply is essential for the 
survival of all living creatures. The demand of energy is increasing day by day with the development of life style. For this increasing demand of energy man is looking for newer 
sources of energy. We need to have clear idea about the sources of energy to save the 
living beings and to continue the supply of energy. We know that the sun is the only source of all energy. Moreover, the nuclear energy in the nucleus and the energy from 
the hot melted substances are considered to  be the sources of energy. All the existing 
energy of the world is directly or indirectly comes from the sun or are produced using","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 78}"

Chemical Energy/Fuel Energy: 
Man in the ancient time was dependent wholly on the energy of their muscles. 
Afterwards, they learnt to tame the wild animals and use their energy in different work. They used to carry their goods and cultivate la nd with the help of animals. The initial 
stage of civilization was to produce heat energy from burning wood and leaves and 
mechanical energy from current of water and flow of wind. The economic development of human being begins from the use of machine energy. Industrial revolution and 
invention of steam engine reduced men’s dependence on muscle energy of human and 
animals. Man kept operating different machines with the help of steam energy. Fuel is Here,

sources of energy. 
The most common sources of energy are coal, mineral oil and natural gas. Coal, mineral 
oil and natural gas from underground are used as fuel directly or by refining them 
slightly. 
Coal :  
Coal is best known to us as one of the sources of energy. It is an organic substance. Once 
upon a time there were numerous plants and trees. Due to different natural calamities 
and natural consequences the leaves of the trees and their stems were buried underneath the earth and began to coagulate. As a result of chemical changes, the leaves of the trees 
and stems were transformed into coal. Combusti on of coal gives us heat directly. This is 
a well known fuel. Many essential substances can be produced from coal apart from using it as a fuel. Some of the coal products are coal gas, tar, benzene, ammonia, toluene","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 79}"
222,"etc. Coal is used to cook food and to drive the steam engines. In modern age, the main 
use of coal is in thermal power plants. The main fuel in a thermal power station is coal. 
The main problem of a coal fueled power station is that it emits sulphur smog which 
causes acid rain. Though this acid is very weak, it kills the fishes of pond, cannel and lake, destroys forest and damages the sculptures of stone.   
Mineral Oil: 
Petroleum or mineral oil is one of the principal sources of energy. It is widely used as a fuel in the present world. It is being used right from a rural cottage to the most modern 
transport system. Petrol, pitch that is used  to pave roads, kerosene and chemical 
fertilizers are all petroleum products. There is nothing like petrol to be used as fuel. On the other hand, many kinds of artificial fabrics can be developed from petroleum. These 
are terry line, polyester, cashmilon etc. Mo reover, various types of cosmetics are","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 79}"

fell buried in the different layers of sedimentary rock on the bottom of the sea. Due to 
different chemical changes these were transformed into mineral oil. Most of the solid 
regions of the present world were a part of the bottom region of the sea in prehistoric age.  
Natural Gas:

The three sources of energy discussed above are reducing very fast due to the men’s 
increasing demand of energy. The physical condition of the world is such that these 
sources-coal, mineral oil, natural gas cannot be recreated, these are called nonrenewable energy. So men are looking for alternate sources of energy of which solar energy, energy 
from water flow, energy from tide and ebb, geothermal energy, wind energy, biomass etc 
are the main sources. These sources are direc tly or indirectly dependent on the sun. As

many days. More examples of solar energy are- solar water heater, solar cooker etc.

are that the cell produces electricity instantly while solar rays fall upon it. There are 
various uses of solar cell. 
1.  This cell is used to supply electricity in artificial satellites. For this reason the 
artificial satellites move along their orbits for a long time.

Wind flows due to the difference of temperature in the earth surface. Kinetic energy due 
to the air flow can be transferred into electric energy. The machine that transforms energy is called Windmill. People in the ancient time used to lift water from well, sail 
ship using the wind blow. Still today people sail in the boat using air energy. Nowadays

Nuclear energy 
Electricity can be produced by using the energy produced in nuclear reaction. The 
nuclear reaction from which the obtained energy is used to produce electricity is called nuclear fission. Here, uranium is made to react with a neutron of particular amount of energy. This reaction takes place in a nuclear reactor.

4.4 Transformation of energy  
Energy is being transformed continuously from one form to another. Various incidents 
are taking place in this universe due to transformation of energy. Though energy is transforming from one form to more than one form, the total amount of energy in this universe remains unchanged.  
Transformation of energy is required for man, computer or any other machine to work or 
to make any change or to process anything. One form of energy can be used to produce another different form of energy. Actually, one form of energy is simultaneously 
transforming into another form which is known as the transformation of energy. What 
happens when anyone plays guitar? The musc le energy of the artist transforms into","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 83}"

melodious music and travels to our ears. When wood is burned chemical energy is 
released and transforms into heat and light energy. A chemical reaction takes place in an electric cell and the chemical energy of these reactions transforms into electric energy which is used for various purposes.  
When a definite amount of energy of a particular form is transformed how much energy 
is obtained? It can be known from the law of conservation of energy. 
When such a transformation takes place there is no net loss of energy. The energy lost by 
one body is exactly equal to the energy gained by another body. 
In fact, we can neither create energy nor destroy it. In other words the total energy of the 
universe does neither increase nor decrease. The amount of energy that existed in the 
universe at the moment of its creation exis ts till today. This known as conservation of 
energy.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 83}"

Transformation of energy:  
We have mentioned earlier about different forms of energy. All of them are related to 
one another. In other words, it is possible to transform one form of energy into another. 
This is known as transformation of energy. In fact, almost every natural phenomenon 
can be considered as a transformation of energy. Several examples of energy 
transformation are described below. 
1. Transformation of mechanical Energy: 
Rubbing of hands produces heat. In this case mechanical energy is converted into heat 
energy. If we low air in an empty pen cap, mechanical energy is converted into sound 
energy. When water is on a hill or a mountain, potential energy is stored in it. When this water flows down through a spring or river then the potential energy is transformed into 
kinetic energy. This flow of water can rotate a wheel to produce electricity. In this way 
mechanical energy can be transformed into electrical energy.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 84}"
241,"2. Transformation of heat Energy:   
In steam engine heat is used to produce steam for driving train etc. Here heat energy is 
converted into mechanical energy. Heat energy is converted into light energy by 
conducting electric current through the filament of a bulb. If the junction of two different 
metallic substances is heated, the heat energy is converted into electric energy. 
3. Transformation of light energy:   
If we touch the chimney of a lantern we feel it to be hot. Here the light energy is 
converted into heat energy. Action of light on a photovoltaic cell converts light energy 
into electric energy. Due to the action of light on a photographic film light energy is 
transformed into chemical energy.

Food and fuel, such as oil, gas, coal and wood are the sources of chemical energy. The 
energy of food is released in our body by chemical reaction and we can work when this","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 84}"

boiler, transformation of energy takes place. In an electric cell chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy. In the filament of an electric bulb, electrical energy is transformed into light and heat energy. 
5. Transformation of electrical energy: 
In electric motor electric energy is transfor med into mechanical energy. In instruments 
like heater, electric iron etc. electric energy is converted into heat energy. In electric bulbs electric energy is converted into light energy. The receiver of a telephone or radio 
converts electrical energy into sound energy. In a storage cell electric energy is 
converted into chemical energy. In electromagnets electric energy is converted into 
magnetic energy.

In nuclear submarine nuclear energy is transformed into mechanical energy.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 84}"

We can understand from the electric power station that the way energy is transformed from 
one form to another and we get light and heat  energy in our houses. By burning coal and 
natural gas in a power station, we can obtain chemical and heat energy. Heat energy is 
converted into mechanical energy with the help  of turbine which rotates the coil of electric 
generator. In this process electrical energy is produced. Electric bulb and heater of houses 
and factories transform electrical into light and heat energy. 
Again, which energy is transformed into what type of energy when we pierce a nail into wood by hammering it? The chemical energy of our boy is used to lift the hammer upward 
which is stored as potential energy due to th e higher position of it. When it moves down the 
potential energy stored is transformed into kine tic energy. This kinetic energy is used to 
pierce the nail into wood. At the same time s ound energy and heat energy in nail, wood and","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 85}"

cannot make use of all the heat energy as we can use light or electric energy.  
4.5 Power 
We all are familiar with the word power. In our daily life power is usually related to taking 
decision and implementation. In science the word  “power” is related to the devices motor, 
pump, and engine etc. i.e. any device that can  work. Sometimes we want to solve any task 
quickly. Suppose we want to fill a water tank on the roof of a multistoried building taking 
water from its reservoir at the ground floor or fro m a pond. It takes a lo t of time if we want 
to fill the tank carrying water with a bucket. It takes less time to fill the tank with the help of 
a motor or a pump. Sometimes a work is done quickly or slowly. Power is the measure of a source by which how fast or how slow a sour ce can work is measured. Suppose two friends-","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 85}"
246,"Roni and Oni live on the fifth floor of a building. The mass of the two friends is the same. 
Coming to the lift at the ground floor they found the lift not working. They had to use the stairs to go up the building. Roni took 40 seconds and Oni took 80 seconds to reach the 5
th 
floor. We say Roni has more power than Oni. Though both of them has done same amount 
of work to reach the same height Roni has mo re power because he has done the work faster. 
Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Po wer of a person or a source is 
measured by the amount of work done per unit time. 
Power = Work
Time  
If as person or a device can do W amount of work or transform energy at time t then the 
power P will be, P =                    (4.4)

Unit:  We can get the unit of power by dividing the unit of work with that of time. Since 
the unit of work is joule (J) and the unit of time is second (s), the unit of power will be 
Joule/second (J/s). It is called Watt. Watt is denoted by W. 
If one joule work is done in one second or the rate of transformation of energy is called 
one watt. 
1W = 1J
1S  = 1 Js-1  
Since watt is very smaller, its thousan d times larger unit kilo-watt is used. 
1 kilo-watt = 1000 watt You have probably heard the word “Horse Power”. This unit of power was used earlier. 
Still today this unit is sometimes used to mean the power of a motor or a car. 
1 Horse Power = 746 watt

work or energy. We usually pay the bill of el ectricity of houses, factories etc measured","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 86}"

electrical energy to light and heat energy in one second.

joules energy in one second. We are using this energy in houses, factories and offices.

4.6 Efficiency: 
We fulfill our daily needs with the help of transformation of ener gy. For example we run 
an engine by transforming chemical energy stored in petrol into kinetic energy. According to the principle of conservation of energy, we should obtain the amount of energy which is given to the engine. But it is seen that the energy gained is always less 
than the energy given to. This is because some energy is lost due to the work done against the frictional force of the engine. The amount of energy obtained from the engine is called effective energy. In this  case the equation of energy is, 
Given energy = Effective energy + the energy lost in other ways 
The efficiency of an engine means that how much of the given energy is obtained as 
effective energy. So, the efficiency means the ratio of effective energy and the total given energy. Usually the efficiency is expressed in percentage. 
∴ efficiency, η =    × 100%","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 87}"
252,"Energy transformation takes place in different steps in a normal electricity production 
centre. This transformation continues from coal, oil, natural gas or Uranium up to the production of electricity. It is seen that up to 70% of this energy is lost as heat energy. 
At last only the 30% of input energy is transformed into useable electrical energy. So, 
we can say the efficiency of the electricity production centre is 30%. 
Mathematical Example 4.5: An electric motor is used to lift a body of weight 10N at a 
height 5m. It uses electrical energy of 65J. 
a) What is the energy lost by the motor? 
b) Find the efficiency of the motor.

a) Here, energy used = work done 
      = Force x displacement 
      = Weight x height       = 10N x 5m

5.1 Pressure and Area  
Can you stand on a single leg easily that you can do by using your two legs? The shoes 
pierce into the mud when one walks on soft mud wearing a high hill. But if one does so 
wearing a flat pair of shoes, then it does not get into the mud. We will see that it happens due to the change of pressure.  
 
Fig-5.1 
The force exerted perpendicularly to unit are of a body is called pressure. Let a force F 
act perpendicularly on area A of a surface, then pressure, P = F
A                                          
i.e.   Pressure = Force
Area   
It is noted that less the area A, more is the pressure P and more the force F, more is the 
pressure P. 
Example: 
(i)The area of the sharp edge of a nail is very small. So when the sharp end of the nail is 
placed on a wood like surface and hammered on the flat head of the nail,   comparatively more pressure is exerted on the sharp end  as a result the nail easily enters into the 
substance.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 92}"

(ii)The area of the sharp edge of the knife is very small. So, by placing the sharp edge of 
the knife on a substance if force is applied, then more pressure acts on the substance 
along edge. Therefore the substance can easily be cut.  
Do it yourself:  Hole a paper by a very sharp pin and by a blunt pin. Which one is easier to hole? 
Explain. 
More pressure is felt on the sharper edge of the pin when force is applied on its flat end. 
When force is applied on the flat end of the blunt pin, less pressure is exerted on the blunt end .So, it is easy to hole a paper by a sharper pin.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 92}"

Unit of pressure: 
If we divide the unit of force by the unit of area, we get the unit of pressure. Therefore 
the unit of pressure is Nm-2. It is called pascal (Pa). 
∴ 1Pa = 1Nm-2 
If a force of 1N force is applied perpendicularly to an area of 1m2, then the pressure 
generated is known as 1Pa.

the bottom of the shoe is 200cm2. Find the pressure.

266,"of iron of the same volume into water, we see that the piece of cork floats on water but the piece of iron gets submerged into water. We may say in general that the density of iron is more than the density of cork. So, iron gets sunk into water. Though the volume of the substances are the same, actually the more the density, the heavier the object is, and the less the density, the lighter the object is. The mass per unit volume of a substance is called the density of its materi al. Density is a general property of matter. 
Density of a body depends on its material and temperature.  
Density is denoted by ρ. If the mass of a body is m and its volume is V,  
then density ρ = m

Take this inverted end of the tube along with your finger inside the pure mercury contained in a container. Now remove the finger and take necessary steps to keep the tube vertical. It will be observed that the mercury has come down to some extent and has attained a steady position. It might appear apparently that the mercury inside the tube is in standing position by itself. But in reality it is not so. It happens so due to air pressure. Atmosphere is always exerting pressure on the mercury of the container.  This pressure is convoyed through the mercury and acts in the upward direction in the tube. This very pressure holds the mercury column of the tube. In absence of this pressure th e mercury of the tube will come down due to,"{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 95}"

Generally the height of the mercury column that remains in the tube in about 76cm i.e. the air pressure supports the pressure of 76cm column of mercury. In this way using the height of a liquid the atmospheric pressure can be measured.  
The space that remains just above the mercury column in the tube up to its closed end is 
totally empty. This empty space is termed as Torricelli’s vacuum. Only a scarce amount 
of mercury vapor exists there. The apparatus used to measure the air pressure is called 
barometer.

274,"height of the atmosphere. On the earth’s surface and on sea level the normal air pressure is 76cm of mercury pressure. With the increase of altitude from the sea-level the weight and density of air-column decreases. So, the air pressure reduces with the increase of height. The atmospheric pressure on the peak of Mount Everest is about 30% of the sea-level air pressure. For this reason respiration becomes difficult at such a high level. There is a possibility of bleeding from the nose at high altitude as atmospheric pressu re is considerably low there. Nowadays 
normal pressure is kept inside a plane for the convenience of the passengers when it flies at a very high altitude and low pressure region. With the increase of height from the earth’s surface the pressure of the atmosphere  decreases. The change of pressure of the 
atmosphere with altitude is shown in the graph [Fig: 5.4].","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 95}"

1. If the height of the mercury decreases gradually then it would be understood that the 
pressure of water vapor is gradually increasing because water vapor is lighter than air. It indicates the possibility of rain.   
2. All of a sudden if the mercury height falls down then it is to be realized that the 
atmospheric pressure of the surrounding area has fallen down and low pressure has been created. The air at a high pressure from the neighboring area will rush with tremendous speed to the depression area. So, there is a possibility of storm.

5.6 Pressure at a point in a liquid at equilibrium 
Pressure at a point in a liquid means a force exerted perpendicularly by the liquid on unit area around that point in the liquid. In fig. 5.5 some liquid is kept in a vessel.   
Let the area of the base of the vessel = A  
density of the liquid = 
ρ

278,"proportional to the depth of that point from the free surface of the liquid and its density. Therefore pressure rises with the increase of depth of the liquid and also increase in density causes the rise of pressure.

A fluid is a substance which flows or is capable of flowing. Fluids are of two types - liquids and gases. 
Pressure of a fluid:  The force exerted perpendicularly by a fluid at rest on unit area of a 
surface is called pressure. If the area of the surface is A and the force applied perpendicularly by the fluid is F, then pressure p = 
F/A. 
Buoyancy:  A water filled pitcher is easy to move in water but it 
is not that much easy to move keeping it out of water. The pitcher is felt considerably lighter in immersed condition as upward thrust acts on it.  
Therefore, the thrust acting vertically upward is equal to the","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 97}"
280,"weight of equal volume of water displaced by the submersed body. For this reason an immersed body apparently losses its weight.  
Magnitude of buoyancy:  
Every point of a body immersed in a fluid will experience thrust in all directions. Let a cylinder PQRS is of cross-sectional area A and height h. It is submersed in a fluid of density  ρ. The depth of the upper and lower surface of the cylinder from the free surface 
of the fluid are h
1 and h 2 respectively.  
So, h = h 2 – h 1 
The downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah 1ρg 
The upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah 2ρg 
The lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. 
∴ Upward thrust or buoyancy

= Ah 2ρg – Ah 1ρg

5.8 Floatation and immersion of a body  
Two forces act simultaneously on a body when it is released in a liquid at rest.  
1.  The weight of the body, W1 acts vertically downwards. 
2.  The buoyancy W2 acts vertically upward on an immersed 
body. There are three conditions of floatation and immersion 
of a body-        
a)  If W1> W2, i.e. when the weight of the body is greater than 
the buoyancy of the liquid the body sinks.  
In this case the weight of the body is more than the weight of 
the displaced liquid. 
b)  If W1=W 2 i.e. when the weight of the body equals to the buoyancy of the liquid the 
body floats being fully immersed in liquid. In such situation the weight of the body 
is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced. 
c)  If W1<W2 i.e. the weight of the body is less than the buoyancy of the liquid, the body 
does not sink. It floats being partly immersed in liquid. In such a position the weight 
of the body is less than the displaced water.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 98}"

Experiment:  Take a body of known weight. Tie the body by a light thread and dip it into a 
container completely filled with water. Some water will spill out of the vessel. Take the 
weight of the body in completely submersed condition. Now find out the apparent loss of 
weight by subtracting the weight of the body immersed in water from the known weight of the

 Causes of accidents in waterway in Bangladesh  
Accidents occur frequently in the waterways in our country. When a ship is made, its 
size and shape both are made in such a way that at the floating state the weight of the 
water displaced by the immersed part of the body is equal to the weight of the ship. 
Now as more passengers get onboard, the more of its weight increases and it keeps 
immersing into water. When more passengers than its capacity get on the ship, it sinks. 
According to weather signals a ship will have to sail carefully taking less number of passengers than its capacity as current and waves are there in the river. Due to defective 
design of the ship its centre of mass ch anges and becomes the cause of accident. One

5.10: Pascal’s Law 
If pressure is applied on any point of an encl osed liquid or gas it is transmitted in all 
directions. Pascal stated a law about this transmission of pressure.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 99}"
286,"Pascal’s law:  External pressure applied to any portion of a liquid or a gas enclosed in a 
container is equally transmitted in all directions in the liquid or the gas without any trace 
of diminution and acts perpendicularly on the surface of the container in contact with the liquid or gas. 
Mathematical explanation of Pascal’s la w: principle of multiplications of force 
On any portion of a confined liquid if force is applied by a smaller piston, then forces of greater magnitudes are 
exerted on the pistons of greater cross sectional area. 
This is known as principle of multiplication of force. 
Let, C
1 and C 2 be two cylinders (Fig:5.10) and A 1 
and A 2 be their cross sectional areas respectively. The 
two cylinders are connected by a pipe. There is an air tight piston in each cylinder. The two cylinders are filled up with a liquid. Now a force F applied to the smaller piston 
generates a pressure F
1/A1. According to Pascal’s law this pressure is transmitted in all","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 99}"
287,"directions through the liquid. Therefore the upward pressure exerted on the larger piston is F
1/A1. Because of this pressure, the larger piston experiences an upward force equal to 
(F1/A1) × A 2. If the upward force of larger piston is F 2, 
then F2  =   F1
A1 × A 2   
     ∴    F2
F1   = A2
A1                              (5.4) 
So, greater is the cross sectional area of the larger piston, the greater is the force exerted 
on it. If the cross sectional area of the larger one is 100 times greater than that of the 
smaller one, then a force of 1N applied to the smaller one will produce an upward force 
of 100N on the larger piston. Figur: 5.10","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 99}"

5.11 Elasticity: Stress and Strain  
From our general knowledge we know a rubber tape elongates along its length when it is 
pulled. As soon as the tape is released of the tension it regains its original length or tends 
to get back its previous length. Here pull means application of force and elongation in length means deformation. Actually as deformation of a body occurs, a resistive force 
generates within the body for which it tends to get back its original size and shape. 
Elasticity is defined as the attributed property by which a body is able to resist 
deformation, either in shape or in volume or both and recovers its original shape and size 
when the deforming force is removed. The substances which possess this property are 
called elastic substances. There is a certain li mit of the deforming force and if the force 
applied exceeds the limit the body then unable to regain its previous shape and size. This 
limit of applied force is termed as elastic limit.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 100}"
289,"The molecules of a substance move away form each other when external force is applied 
on elastic bodies. Original length, volume or size and shape of a body are changed due to 
this applied deforming force. The change per unit length or per unit volume of an object 
is called strain. Whenever an external force deforms a body, an internal resistive force will develop inside the body due to its elastic property. This opposing force comes into 
play to resist the applied external force. This developed internal restoring force acting 
perpendicularly per unit area of the body is called strain.  
Hooke’s law:  Scientist Robert Hooke invented the basic law of elasticity. According to 
this law- within elastic limit stress is directly proportional to strain.  
Mathematically we may write, stress ∝ strain  
∴ stress = constant × strain.

5.12. Molecular kinetic theory of matter  
The basic conception of the molecular kinetic 
theory of matter is to consider that the molecules of a matter are in motion. The kinetic theory of 
matter is based on the following postulates:  
1. Any substance consists of innumerable 
number of minute particles. These particles are called molecules. 
2. The molecules are so small that they are considered as points. 
3. The molecules of a substance are always in motion.  
4. The gaseous molecules remain at a considerable distance. For this reason almost no 
force of attraction and repulsion act between them. Though the liquid molecules remain at some distance, force of attraction between them prevails. This cause Figur: 5.11","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 100}"

compels the liquid to take the shape of the container in which it is kept. In solid 
substances the particles remain very close to each other and very strong attractive 
force exists in them which give the solid substance a definite size and volume. 
5. The molecules move at random in liquid and gas. So, these molecules collide among 
themselves and also on the surface of the walls of the container.

high temperature. The main source of plasma is the Sun. Except this the other stars are

6.1 Heat and Temperature 
Heat: 
Heat is a kind of energy which creates the sensation of hotness and coldness. Heat flows 
from hotter to colder bodies. Therefore th e energy that transfers from one body to 
another due to the difference of temperature is called heat. 
The molecules of a substance always remain in the state of vibratory motion. So they 
possess kinetic energy. The total amount of energy of a substance is directly proportional to the sum of the kinetic energy of the mo lecules constituting the substance. When heat 
is applied to a body the motion of the molecules increases and as a result the kinetic energy of the molecules increases.  
Unit of Heat: In SI system the unit of heat is joule (J). Earlier the unit of heat used to be 
calorie (Cal). The relation between joule and calorie is 1Cal = 4.2 J.

the container B. Now dip your right hand in the container A and left hand in the container C. After one minute bring out both hands and immerse both hands at the same time in the container B. What are the feelings of your two hands?  
 
Water at a certain temperature is in the container B; yet hotness will be felt by the right 
hand and coldness by the left hand. Because the water in which the right hand was immersed previously was at a lower temperature than the water contained in B. Similarly coldness will be felt by the left hand because the water in which the left hand was immersed previously was at a higher temperature than the water contained in B. 
Temperature 
Temperature is such a thermal condition of a body which determines whether the body","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 105}"
302,"will receive or give up heat when it comes in thermal contact with another body. 
Temperature may be compared with the free surface of a liquid. We know that liquid 
flows from a higher level to a lower level. In the figure the height of liquid in vessel A is more than that of the liquid in vessel B. But the amount of liquid in vessel A is less than the amount of liquid in vessel B. When stop cork S is opened the liquid from vessel A will start flowing to vessel B until the height of the liquid on both sides become equal. In the same way after the thermal contact, heat continues to flow from hotter body to colder one until the temperatures of the both bodies come to equilibrium position. The body with more temperature will lose heat whereas the body having less temperature will gain heat. The name of the apparatus used to measure the temperature is called thermometer.  Fig: 6.1

Special properties of matter are used to measure the temperature. Some physical 
properties of substances change uniformly with the change of temperature. Using that 
physical property of substance temperature can be measured easily and accurately and it

6.3 Relation among Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale: 
A scale of temperature is essential to indicate the temperature of a body accurately. Two

other three scales are C, F and K respectively.  Therefore the readings of distance PA in

On the basis of molecular kinetic theory of substances we know that the molecules of a 
substance always remain in motion. The molecules of a solid vibrate about a fixed point. 
The molecules of liquids and gases move at  random in different directions. Kinetic 
energy develops due to this motion of the molecules. Again attraction and repulsion

the molecules of a substance is called its intern al energy. Evidently a part of the internal 
energy originates from kinetic energy and the other part from potential energy. If thermal energy is applied to a body then its internal energy will increase. But only the 
kinetic energy of the internal energy causes the raise of temperature of the body. Given,

In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecule s relative to their equilibrium position","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 108}"
311,"increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the 
case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less 
in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it. For gaseous substances with the increase of temperature the random motion of the molecules increases. The thermal expansion of gases is maximum. The expansion of liquid is lower than that of gas and expansion of solid is the least.

The area of a solid  is increased with  the increase of temperature. It is

Volume Expansion and Coefficient of Volume Expansion: 
The volume of a solid substance increases if its temperature is 
increased. It is called volume expansion. 
Let, the initial volume of a substance be V1 and initial temperature 
be θ1. When the temperature is raised to  θ2, its volume becomes V2 
after being increased. There increase in volume is V2 – V 1 and 
increase of temperature = θ2 - θ1. 
Now if the coefficient of volume expansion is represented by γ, then  
γ =                                 … … … (6.4)

In equation 6.4 if the initial volume V1 = 1m3 and increase of temperature, θ2 - θ1 = 1K, 
then  
γ = V 2 – V 1 = increase in volume. 
Therefore, the increase in volume of a solid of volume 1m3 for a rise of temperature 1K 
is called the coefficient of volume expansion of the material of the solid.

6.7 Expansion of liquids: 
Liquids have no definite length or area. But it has definite volume. If the temperature is 
increased its volume increases. So, the expansion of liquid means the expansion in volume of the liquid. The rates of increase in volume of all the liquids are not the same. Different liquids having the same volume expand differently for the same rise of temperature.

Now water at room temperature is taken in a comparatively larger vessel and the bulbs are placed vertically in it. The upper level of the liquids in all the bulbs will be the same. Now some hot water is poured into the vessel. After some time the bulbs will attain a higher temperature and it will be seen in the stem of the bulbs the upper level of different liquids are not at the same height rather their heights are different. So, it is understood that the volumes of different liquids of same volume expand differently for a definite increase of temperature.

6.8 Real and apparent expansion of liquids 
Liquid always has to be heated keeping it in a container. The liquid as well as the 
container expand when heat is applied. So, the expansion of the liquid observed by us is not the real expansion but it is an apparent expansion. 
There are two types of expansions of liquids- 
a. Real expansion 
b. Apparent expansion 
Real expansion: 
If it had been possible to heat a liquid without keeping it in a vessel then the real 
expansion of the liquid that would be obtaine d is called real expansion of the liquid. But 
heating a liquid without a container is not possible. So, considering the expansion of the container the actual expansion of the liquid that is obtained is called the real expansion. It is expressed by V
r. 
Apparent expansion: 
The expansion of liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the 
container is called the apparent expansion of liquid. It is denoted by V a.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 111}"
320,"Relation between real expansion and apparent expansion: 
A glass bulb with a long graduated stem is filled with liquid up to the mark A. Now 
keeping an eye on the liquid column the bulb is heated and it is observed that the upper level of the liquid comes down from position A to position B. After that it moves up from the graduated line B crossing the mark A and reaches to mark C. The reason is that when heat is applied the volume of the bulb increases at first. Due to this cause liquid comes down to B from A. Later on as soon as the liquid gets heated its volume starts to increase and reaches from B to C. It happens so as the expansion of liquid is more than the expansion of solid. Apparently it appears to us that the liquid was at mark A and finally reaches to mark C. Therefore, CA is the apparent expansion. CB is the real 
expansion and AB indicates the expansion of the container.

6.9 Effect of heat on change of state: 
Matter can exist in three states e.g. solid, liquid and gas. All of us know 
that water has three states-ice, water and vapor. These three states are called solid, liquid and gas. These states of water depend on air pressure and temperature. 
A solid may be liquefied by applying heat. This process is called fusion. At the 
beginning the temperature of a body rises with the application of heat and at one stage 
the temperature does not change even if more heat is applied. At this moment the 
Fig: 6.8","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 111}"
322,"108  Physics 
amount of heat absorbed by a body is used to convert the solid into liquid only. If heat is 
applied to ice below 0°C, temperature will rise and reach at 0°C. After this if more heat 
is applied the temperature will not rise but the ice will begin to melt to water. The 
amount of heat absorbed during the conversion of a solid to liquid is used to break the intermolecular bond of the molecules.  
On further heating the temperature of water of 0°C starts to rise. At a stage, water starts 
vaporizing and the temperature remains unchanged. During this time water absorbs heat to become vapor. Here also the effect of heat is used to break the intermolecular bond 
among the liquid molecules. On the other way around, gaseous substance may be 
converted to liquid and liquid to solid by extracting heat from them. So, on the transformation of substances effect of heat is remarkable.

To transform a substance from solid to liquid by applying heat is called fusion. The 
definite temperature at which a solid starts to melt is called its melting point. This

Vaporization 
The phenomenon of transformation of a liquid from its liquid state to gaseous state is 
called vaporization. This vaporization may occur in two processes- 
i) Evaporation 
ii) Boiling 
Evaporation 
The process in which a liquid at any temperature slowly changes from its free surface 
into vapor state is called evaporation.

happens to the water after one or two days. It will be observed that the water has been reduced. 
What is the cause for the reduction of this water?

amount of water has been lessened. This is called evaporation. 
Boiling","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 112}"
324,"Boiling 
The process in which a liquid is rapidly converted into vapor by increasing its 
temperature through application of heat is called boiling.  
The temperature at which boiling of liquid be gins is called the boiling point of that 
liquid. The value of boiling point depends on pressure. 
Experiment: Pouring  some water in a container and supplying heat the gradual increase of 
temperature would be observed. At a certain te mperature the water will begin to boil and get 
converted into water vapor. It is called boiling. So, it is understood that liquid may be converted 
into its gaseous state at any temperature or at its boiling point.

 6.11 Effect of pressure on boiling point 
Do it yourself:  Press two pieces of ice together for some  time keeping them in contact with each 
other and then release. What do you observe? The pieces of ice have joined together. Why? 
As the pressure acts on the surface of contact of the two pieces of 
ice, the melting point goes down  i.e. the melting point becomes 
less than 0°C. But the temperature of the surface of contact remains at 0°C. So, ice at the surface of contact melts. The required amount of heat needed for melting is collected from the ice. After the removal of pressure the melting point again becomes 0°C. As a result the water obtained from the fusion of ice at the surface of contact again freezes to ice. For this reason if pressure is applied then two pieces of ice unite together to form a single piece.  
To melt a solid substance into liquid by applying pressure and again to bring it back to 
the solid state by reducing the pressure is called regelation.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 113}"
326,"The melting point of a substance changes due to the variation of pressure on the 
substance. The changes of melting point may occur in two different ways for pressure. 
• The solid substances whose volumes contr act on melting, their melting points reduce 
with the increase of pressure i.e. they melt at a lower temperature. 
• The solid substances whose volumes expand on melting, their melting points 
increase with the increase of pressure i.e. they melt at a higher temperature.     
6.12 Latent heat of fusion and latent heat of vaporization 
Latent heat of fusion:  We know, when the temperature of a solid reaches the melting 
point due to application of heat then the temperature remain unchanged until all the substances transform into liquid. Here the amount of heat required to transform the solid into liquid is nothing but latent heat of fusion.  
This heat energy does not change the te mperature but is used to loosen the 
intermolecular bond of the molecules of the substances.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 113}"
327,"Latent heat of vaporization:  If heat is applied  to a liquid  and its temperature  reaches at

Evaporation produces cooling: In summer days the water kept in a new earthen pitcher becomes cold. Uncountable 
numbers of pores are there on the body of an earthen pitcher. Through these pores water seeps out and evaporates. The needed amount of latent heat is provided by the water of the pitcher and as such the water becomes cold.

The area of the exposed surface of the liquid:  Evaporation increases as the area of the 
exposed surface of the liquid increases. 
Nature of liquid: The rates of evaporation of different liquids are different. Less the 
boiling point of a liquid, more would be the rate of evaporation. The rate of evaporation of volatile substances is maximum. 
Pressure on the liquid: The rate of evaporation decreases with the increase of 
atmospheric pressure on the liquid. The rate of evaporation increases with the decrease 
of pressure. The rate of evaporation in vacuum is maximum.

Effect of dryness: The more the dryness of the air  over the liquid surface i.e. the less the 
amount of water vapor in the air more will be the rate of evaporation. The soaked cloths dry up quickly in winter because air remains dry at that time.

joule heat is required to raise the temperature of the body through 1K.

to increase the  temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of 1kg the amount of heat 
required = S joule 
∴ to increase the  temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of m kg the amount of 
heat required = mS joule

WAVES AND SOUND 
 
 
 
[If we throw a stone into pond water, we see the wave. Wave carries energy from one 
place to another. Sound is a kind of wave. The sound energy can create the sensation of hearing. We can send information using sound. So the sound is closely related to our 
life. But sound pollution causes much harm to us. We shall discuss wave, sound, echo of 
sound, velocity of sound, sound pollution etc. in this chapter.]

7.1 Periodic Motion Oscillatory or Harmonic Motion 
Periodic motion:  
If the motion of a moving particle is such that it passes through 
a definite point along the path of its motion in the same direction in a definite interval of time, this type of motion is 
called periodic motion.  The hands of the watch and the 
electric fans are the examples of circular periodic motion. The contraction and expansion of spring is the linear periodic 
motion. The time required for a complete oscillation of an 
object executing periodic motion is called its time period. 
Oscillatory or harmonic motion: 
If a body executing periodic motion moves in a definite direction for one 
half of its time period and exactly for the other half in the opposite direction then this motion is called oscillatory or harmonic motion. If any 
spring is hung from a strong support and an object is attached at the","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 119}"
340,"lower end and released after stretching, the spring will vibrate up and down. This type of motion is known as oscillatory or harmonic or 
vibratory motion. Motion of a simple pendulum and motion of a 
vibrating tuning fork is harmonic motion.  
7.2 Waves 
A stone is thrown on the still water of the pond. When the stone hits the water then the 
particles of water of that region start to vibrate. These vibrating particles vibrate the neighboring of particles. Thus the vibration reaches to the edge of the pond by vibrating 
the particles of water. The particles of water oscillate up and down but do not move 
forward. The periodic vibration that passes over the surface of water due to the oscillatory motion of the particles is called wave. The mechanical energy produced due 
to the vibration of water particles is transferred from one place to another through 
vibration. So, energy is transferred from one place to another through wave.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 119}"
341,"The periodic motion of particles which transfers energy 
from one place to another through a material medium but 
does not displace the particles permanently is called wave. 
The wave produced in solid, liquid or gaseous medium is 
called mechanical wave. Water wave, sound wave etc. are 
mechanical waves. To transfer the mechanical wave elastic medium is needed. There is another type of wave that does 
not need any medium to propagate which are called electromagnetic wave. 
It is mentionable that we will limit discussion only to the mechanical wave in this 
chapter. Here the wave means the wave produced in elastic medium.  
The characteristics of waves are the followings: 
1. The wave is produced due to the harmonic motion of   the particles but the particles 
are not displaced permanently. 
Figure: 7.1 
Figure: 7.2 
Figure: 7.3","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 119}"
342,"116  Physics 
2. A medium is necessary for the propagation of mechanical wave. 
3. The wave transfers energy from one place to another. 
4. The velocity of wave depends on the nature of medium. 
5. The reflection, refraction and superposition occur in case of wave.  
Classification of wave: 
There are two kinds of wave: 
1. Transverse wave   2. Longitudinal wave 
Task:  Take a long rope as in the figure. Attach one end of the rope with a strong support. 
Move your hand right and left or up and down by holding the other end. 
A wave will be created in the rope as in the figure 7.4. Observe that the movement or the 
vibration of the hand is from left to right or from top to 
bottom but the motion of wave is horizontal. Here the direction of vibration of the particles is perpendicular to the 
direction of propagation of wave. This very wave is 
transverse wave. So we can say that the wave which moves perpendicularly to the direction of vibration of the particles","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 120}"
343,"is called transverse wave. Water wave is an example of transverse wave.  
 
A spring is set as in the figure 7.5. Now let’s move our hand forward and backward by 
holding the free end of the spring. When we move the hand forward a flow of contraction will be created in the spring. Again if we move the hand backward, a flow of 
rarefaction will be created in the spring. The flow of contraction and rarefaction 
continues to move forward. In this case the movement of hand and the wave moves in the same direction. That means, the direction of vibration of the spring and the motion of 
wave are parallel to each other. So we can say that the wave that travels in a direction 
parallel to the direction of vibration of the particles of the medium is known as 
longitudinal wave. The sound wave in the air me dium is an example of longitudinal wave.   
The highest and the lowest point of a transverse wave are called wave 
crest and wave trough. The similar quantities in the longitudinal wave","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 120}"
344,"are contraction and rarefaction. 
7.3 Wave related quantities 
Complete vibration : 
If a wave transmitting particle moves from a certain point and again 
comes back to the same point then the motion is called complete 
vibration.

345,"Physics  117 
Time period:  
The time interval in which the wave is repeated that is the times required for one 
complete vibration of a wave transmitting pa rticle is known as its time period. It is 
expressed by the letter T and its unit is second (s). 
 
Frequency: 
The number of complete vibrations in one second of a wave transmitting particle is 
known as its frequency. Wave is produced from a vibrating object. So the frequency of 
vibrating object is equal to the frequency of the wave. The unit of frequency is Hertz 
(Hz). If a vibrating particle executes one complete vibration in one second then its 
frequency is called 1 Hz. It is expressed by ‘ƒ’.  The relation between frequency and 
time period is ƒ =T1 
Amplitude:  
To produce a wave the particles need to vibrate about their equilibrium position. The 
maximum displacement of a wave transmitti ng particle from the position of equilibrium 
is called amplitude. In the figure ‘a’ is amplitude. 
 
Phase:","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 121}"
346,"Phase:  
The overall condition of motion of a wave transmitting particle at any moment is known 
as phase. The overall condition means the displacement, velocity and acceleration etc of 
the particle at a certain time. The wave crest or the wave trough always remains in the same phase in case of a transverse wave. 
In the figure the particles of points P and P’
 or R and R’ are in same phase. 
Wavelength:  
The distance between the two successive particles of same phase is called wave length. 
Wave length is defined as the distance through which a wave travels in a time during 
which a wave transmitting particle completes one oscillation. Wave length is expressed 
by λ. Its unit is meter (m). 
In the figure the distance PP’ or RR’ or SS’ is wavelength, λ.  
Wave velocity: The distance that a wave travels in one second  in a particular direction is called wave 
velocity. Figure: 7.7

347,"118  Physics 
7.4 A few relations  
The relation between frequency and time period: 
We know that the number of complete vibrations of a vibrating particle in one second is 
called its frequency. Frequency is denoted by ƒ. Again the time period is the time of one 
complete vibration. 
If the time period is T, then in T second, the number of vibration is 1 
Therefore, the number of vibration in one second is T1
  
The number of vibration in 1 second is frequency. So, the frequency, ƒ= 1
T                   (7.1) 
The relation between wave velocity and wavelength: 
We know that number of complete vibrations in one second is called frequency. Again 
the distance travelled by the wave during one complete oscillation is called wavelength. 
So, if the wavelength is λ,  
therefore, the distance travelled in the time of 1 complete vibration= λ 
∴ the distance travelled in the time of f complete vibrations = ƒ λ","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 122}"
348,"Since the frequency is ƒ, so f numbers of waves are produced in 1 second. ∴ the distance travelled in one second by the wave = ƒ λ  
This is the velocity of wave, v. 
Therefore, velocity of wave, v = ƒλ … … … (7.2) 
Mathematical example 7.1: The wavelength of sound produced by an object in the air 
is 20cm .If the velocity of sound in the air is 340ms
-1, find the frequency and period of 
the object.

7.5. Sound Wave:  
We know that the sound is a power. This power is 
circulated through wave. Sound wave is a longitudinal wave. During the circulation of this wave, the detraction 
and expansion of the substance are created (Fig 
7.9).This sound wave makes a sense of hearing in our ear by being circulated from the medium. It is","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 122}"
349,"noticeable that the sound is not created without 
vibration. When tune-pin copper, bowl, the bell of school is ringing, you will understand that they are vibrating if you touch them. When you speak, you will see that your throat

Activities:  Take water in a brass bowl. Strike the bowl. You can hear sound. Small waves are 
seen on the water. Now hold the bowl by your hand. Can you hear sound now? Is there any 
wave in water?  
As long as the bowl produces sound it continues its vibration. 
So, small waves are produced in water. While the vibration of the bowl stops, the sound stops, so does the wave. So it is 
understood that a vibrating object can produce sound. But it 
does not mean that any vibration of any object can produce audible sound. For an audible sound there must have a 
material medium between the source of sound and the listener, 
and the frequency will be in between 
20Hz to 20000Hz . 
Characteristics of sound wave: 
Vibration of an objects produces sound wave and an elastic material medium is needed 
for its propagation. So, sound is called a mechanical wave. Since the direction of propagation of wave and of particles are in the same direction, so is longitudinal. The","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 123}"
351,"velocity of sound wave depends on the nature of the medium. The velocity   of sound in 
gaseous medium is less, high in liquid and higher in solid. The intensity of sound wave 
is directly to the square of its amplitude. So higher the amplitude, the higher is the intensity. 
Reflection, refraction and superposition are possi ble in case of sound wave. The velocity of 
sound wave depends on the temperatur e and the humidity of medium too.   
7.6 Echo 
If anyone produces a sound standing near the bank of a river, many of us have the 
experience of hearing the repetition of that sound after a while. The same case happens if we produce sound standing near a hill or a building. If a sound is produced in a big 
empty house, the same sound   is heard just after a while. These phenomena take place 
due to the reflection of sound. When a sound becomes separate from its original sound and is repeated due to reflection then this reflected sound is called echo. Simply we can","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 123}"
352,"say that the reflection of sound is echo. 
The minimum distance of reflector 
A sound that is heard persists 0.1 second in our brain. It is called the persistence period of 
hearing. If any new sound reaches our ear in th is period we cannot hear it. Therefore for 
hearing an echo of any sound the distance between the source of sound and reflector must be such that the reflected wave cannot come back to the listener before a time of 0.1 second. If 
the velocity of sound in the air at 0°C is considered to be 332ms
-1 then in 0.1 sec sound can 
travel 33.2 m. Therefore a reflector must be placed at a minimum distance of 33.2/2 or 16.6 m from the listener. 
Now tell why echo is not heard in a small house? 
7.7 Uses of echo 
Determination of the depth of a well: 
Depth of water surface of a well can be very easily determined by 
means of echo. When a sound is produced at the mouth of the 
well, it being reflected from its water surface heard in the form of         Figure: 7.10","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 123}"
353,Figure: 7.11,"{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 123}"
354,"120  Physics 
echo. The time between the production of sound and the hearing of echo is determined 
by means of a stopwatch.  
Let, 
depth of well = h  
the time difference between the production of sound and hearing of echo = t  
 Speed of sound = v  Now the distance travelled by reflected sound to the listener is 2h. Therefore, 
2h = V × t  
or, h =  
If the depth of the well is less than 16.6m, it will not be possible to perform this 
experiment as it is based on echo. 
In the same way this method can also be used to find mineral substances in the earth.  
Flying of bat: 
 
Bat flies using the echo of sound as it cannot see. Bat can produce and hear ultrasonic 
sound. We cannot hear ultrasonic sound. Bat produces ultrasonic sound and spread it 
forward which reflects back to the bat from a reflector. Bat can understand from the","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 124}"
355,"reflected sound if there is any object before it. It hunts its prey using this technique. If the sound does not reflect back then it can understand that there is open space and it flies 
that way. Sometimes the bat fails to detect the position of wires of electric lines and flies 
through the parallel wires and gets stuck and becomes dead as soon as the positive and negative electric lines get connected with its  body. This is why sometimes bats are found 
hanging dead from electric lines.  
Bat can produce and hear the sound of frequency about 1,00,000 Hz. 
7.8 Variation of velocity of sound 
It takes some time when sound reaches our ear from its source. The distance travelled by 
sound in one second is called velocity of sound. The velocity of sound depends on some factors. 
Nature of medium: Velocity of sound in different media is different. For example 
velocity of sound in air, water and iron is different. At 20°C the velocity of sound in air is 344ms","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 124}"
356,"-1, in water it is 1450ms-1 and in iron it is 5130ms-1. Generally we can see the 
velocity of sound in air is less, in liquid it is higher and highest in solid.   V × t

 Figure: 7.12","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 124}"
357,"Physics  121 
 
Do it yourself:  Take two empty pots of tin. Connect the pots with a thin wire of 
approximately twenty meter long. Your friend is speaking through a pot. Try to hear that 
sound by putting your ear in contact with another pot. 
Can you hear what your friend is saying? Yes, I can. Here sound is travelling through the 
wire which is a solid substance. 
 
Temperature:  The more the temperature increases, the more the velocity of sound in 
the air increases. For this reason, the velocity of sound is more in summer than that of in 
winter. 
Calculate:  The velocity of sound is 344ms-1 at 20 ˚C temperature and 332ms-1 at 0 ˚. How 
much does the velocity of sound increases  for the increase of temperature by 1°C? 
 
Humidity of air: The velocity of sound increases with  the increase of humidity. For this 
reason, the velocity of sound is more in the humid air than that of in dry air. 
7.9 Audibility range and their uses:","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 125}"
358,"We know, the sound is not produced without vibration. If an object vibrates at least 20 
times per second then the sound produced from that will be heard. Thus, if the frequency 
is more than 20000 Hz; the sound will not be heard also. So, the range of sound that we can hear is from 20 Hz to 20000 Hz. This frequency range is called range of audibility. If the frequency of any source is less than 20 Hz then it is called infrasonic vibration. If the frequency of any source is more than 20000 Hz then it is called ultrasonic vibration. Though man cannot hear the ultrasonic sound animals like bats, dogs, bees can produce and hear it. 
The application and use of Ultrasonic sound: 
 Determination of the depth of ocean: 
 To measure the depth of ocean a machin e is used which is called SONAR. The 
elaboration of SONAR is Sound Navigation And Ranging. There is a system of 
receiving and transmitting ultrasonic sound in this machine.   Figure: 7.13","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 125}"
359,"122  Physics 
 
Figure: 7.14 
The ultrasonic sound is produced and transmitte d through the water with the help of this 
machine and if this sound returns being reflected from the bottom of the ocean, it is 
received by the receiver of the machine. If the recorded time of transmitting and 
receiving is subtracted then the time of trav eling is found. Suppose this time is t and the 
depth of the ocean is d. If the velocity of sound in the water is v, then 
it = vt 
or, d = vt
2                                                                                                                        (7.3)  
The summation of the distance travelled during return and transmission of sound is d+d 
= 2d. 
By knowing the velocity of sound, the depth of ocean can be measured with the help of 
the above equation.

machine. Mixing soap or powder soap with water the clothes are soaked in it then","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 126}"
360,"ultrasonic sound is passed through it. This sound removes the dirt from the clothes and they are cleaned. 
To diagnose disease: As the internal photograph of human body can be captured by X-
ray, in the same way the disease can also be identified by capturing picture through ultrasonic sound. This process is known as  Ultrasonography. This sound is transmitted 
inside the body and the reflected sound is converted into light energy and casted on the 
television screen. As a result, the disease can be identified. 
In medical science:  Ultrasonic sound is used for scaling the teeth or to remove the 
stones from teeth. Ultrasonic sound is also used to remove small stones from kidney by 
turning them into dust. 
For other uses:  
Ultrasonic sound is used to find out fine cracks in metal blocks or metal sheets, to clean 
tiny electronic machines and also to destroy the harmful 
germs. 
The uses of infrasonic sound:  
The range of infrasonic sound is from 1 Hz to 20 Hz. Men","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 126}"
361,"cannot hear this sound but some animals can hear it. Elephants communicate with each other using infrasonic

change. This type of sound is produced during earth quakes and nuclear explosions and 
destroys many things with great shake.  
 Mathematical example 7.3  
A man clapped standing on one of the banks of a river. Echo is heard after 1.5s due to 
the reflection of the sound from another bank. If the velocity of sound at that time is 340ms
-1, what is the breadth of the river? 
Solution:  
Suppose the breadth of river d.  
We know, 
        2d= v.t              
So,    d = vt
2  
        =  340ms-1×1.5 s

so, the width of river is 255m. 
7.10. Musical sound and its characteristics: 
We hear different kind of sounds every day. We hear the sound of vehicles, the sound of 
market, the sound of rainfall, the sound of musical instruments etc every day. Some of 
these sounds are sweet and some are harsh. If we judge by our sensation the sweet sounds are musical sounds. 
The characteristics of musical sound:  
The three characteristics of musical sounds are-","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 127}"
363,"1) Loudness or Intensity   2) Pitch and   3) Quality or Timbre. 
Loudness or Intensity:  
Loudness or intensity means how loud the sound is. Intensity is the amount of sound energy flowing per second per unit area perpendicular to the direction of propagation of 
sound. In SI system of unit the unit of intensity of sound is Wm
-2. 
Pitch:   
The characteristic of musical sound by which we can differentiate between a shrill sound 
and a dull sound of same intensity is called pitch. Pitch depends on the frequency of the 
source. With the increase of frequency the pitch becomes higher making the note more and more shrill. 
Quality or Timbre:   
The characteristic of musical sound by which we can differentiate between two sounds of same intensity and pitch is called quality or timbre.

The vocal chords of adult men become thick as  they age but the vocal chords of children 
and women are not thick. For this, the frequency of voice of the adult men is less and the 
frequency of voice of women and children are more. So the voice of men is deep but the 
voice of children and women is sharp. 
7.11. Noise pollution 
Sound is necessary for mutual communication and exchanging feelings. But the 
unnecessary sounds and noises are intolerable. When the sound from different sources cross the normal limit of tolerance and causes annoyance and harm to health then it is 
called noise pollution. 
The excessive use of mike, the sound of dram, the sound of the explosion of bomb,  the 
sound from industries, the horn of vehicles, loud sound from tape-recorder and television 
put, the sound from the engine of old car, the sound of aero plane and fighter plane etc. 
are the main causes of noise pollution.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 128}"
366,"Continuous loud sound increases mental stress and makes the temper rough. It causes 
vomiting tendency, lack of appetite, high blood-pressure, complex diseases of heart and 
brain, sickness from lack of sleep, tiredness, lack of potentiality, lack of memory, headache etc. Sudden loud sound can damage our hearing. 
At present, noise pollution is creating many severe problems. Very often the patients and 
the examinees become sick due to noise pollution. Reducing noise is the way to remain safe from noise pollution. We can take a few steps in this regard. We have to refrain 
ourselves from using mike loudly in any ceremony. The use of fireworks and bang sticks 
must be banned in the festivals. We should avoid using the horn of vehicles unnecessarily and loudly. We can reduce noise pollution by buying low sound producing 
engine and by establishing industries and airport far from residential area. Open areas","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 128}"
367,"should be preserved in the city and more and more trees should be planted to absorb the noise. By using noise-absorbing machine in the industries and by making people 
conscious the noise pollution can be controlled.

REFLECTION OF LIGHT 
 
  
[We see many things around us. When light comes directly to our eyes from any source, 
we can see the source. Again, when light emitted from a light source comes to our eyes 
after reflection from the surface of any object, we see the object too. Light is a kind of 
energy or external cause which enables us to  see or creates the sense of vision in our 
eyes. In this chapter we will discuss about na ture of light, mirrors, laws of reflection of 
light, types of mirror, how image is formed in a mirror, uses of mirror and magnification 
of images.] 
By the end of this chapter, we will be able to- 
13. Explain nature of light. 
14. Explain the laws of reflection of light. 
15. Explain mirrors. 
16. Explain images. 
17. Explain formation of images in mirrors by drawing action line of light rays. 
18. Explain some common phenomena of formation of images in plane and spherical 
mirrors.  
19. Explain uses of mirrors.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 130}"

8.1 Nature of light   
We know, light is a form of energy by which we are able to see the objects. When light 
comes from an object to our eyes, we see the object at that time. The light entered into 
the eyes forms an image of the object in the retina and develops a sense of vision similar to the object in our brain through a complex process. Men have been trying to achieve 
knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that 
light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object.  
The major properties of light are:  
1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium. 
2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium. The value of this velocity 
in vacuum is 
831 0c=×  ms-1
.  
3. Reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion and polarization of light 
take place.","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 131}"

4. Light is a form of energy. 
5. Light is a kind of electromagnetic wave. 
6. Light behaves as wave in some cases and also as particle in some incidents. 
8.2 Laws of reflection of light 
We see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and 
some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own 
are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, 
chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non-luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the 
object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this 
we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object 
because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 131}"

375,"128  Physics 
In a homogenous transparent medium (e.g.- glass) light travels in straight line with the 
same velocity. But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of 
a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the 
surface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light. 
Laws of reflection: 
The incident and reflected ray obey two simple laws: 
1. First law:  The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence on 
the reflector lie in the same plane.  
2. Second law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.  
 
Figure 8.2: Reflection of light  
When light is reflected from a surface, then it must obey the laws of reflection. How 
light will be reflected from a surface depends upon the nature of the reflecting surface. 
Depending on the nature of the reflecting surface, reflection may be of two kinds.  
1. Regular or uniform reflection","{'source': 'pdf/Physics Classes 9-10.pdf', 'page': 132}"
376,"2. Diffused or irregular reflection  
1. Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after  
reflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of 
light incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains 
parallel even after reflection. In this case, the angle of incidence for each incident ray is the same and the angle of reflection for each of the ray is also the same due to regular 
reflection.

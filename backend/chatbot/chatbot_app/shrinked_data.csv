Consider the specific characteristics of the defect and the impact on visual acuity.","Based on the provided context, it appears that long sight or hypermetropia would allow someone to perceive distant objects clearly but struggle with seeing nearby objects with clarity. This is because the eye has increased power of convergence, causing rays from near objects to converge in front of the retina, making them appear blurry.","['156  Physics \n1. Short sight or Myopia \n2. Long sight or Hypermetropia 1. Short sight or Myopia: If anybody has this problem, he or she cannot see any distant \nobject distinctly but can see anything of near distance distinctly. Sometimes the distance of near point for such an eye is less than 25 cm. Therefore, if the near point of the eye is less than 25cm then that is also considered as short sight. \nCause: This defect may be caused if the radius of  the eye \nball increases or if the focal length decreases for any reason and thereby increases the power of convergence of the eye lens. [Figure 9.22 (a) ] \nEffects of such problem:  In this case, rays of light coming'

The near point N of such an eye shifts away to O, which is more than 25 cm (the distance of the near point for a normal eye). Therefore, such a defective eye cannot see any objects distinctly, which is placed nearer to O [Fig 9.23 (b)].  \nFigure: 9.22  \nFigure: 9.23'

They should have such focal length or power so that due to refraction through the image of an object placed at infinity the image is formed at the far point of the defective eye [ fig 9.22 c]. We know that when the object is at infinity its virtual image is formed at the principal focus of the concave lens. Therefore, the focal length of the concave lens used as spectacles should be equal to the distance of the far point of the defective eye. \n2.

For this kind of eye, the far point is not situated at infinity. Rather, it is a certain finite point F.  For this reason, such type of eye cannot see \nobject distinctly placed beyond F (Fig 9.22(b) ] \nRemedy:  It has been said earlier that such type of defect arises due to the increase in the \npower of convergence of the eye lens. To remedy this defect, we need to decrease the power of convergence of the eye lens. For doing this, concave lens is used as aid lens or as spectacles. \nBesides, only a concave lens can create a virtual, erect and diminished image at a']","This condition describes hyperopia, where distant objects are clear, but nearby objects appear blurry.","This condition describes hyperopia, where distant objects are clear, but nearby objects appear blurry."
1,"When a solid is heated, how does the kinetic energy of its molecules change in relation to the intermolecular forces and vibrational displacements?","As the solid is heated, the kinetic energy of its molecules increases, causing them to vibrate with more energy against intermolecular forces. This results in an increase in molecular displacements from their equilibrium position, with attractive forces increasing at larger distances and repulsive forces increasing at smaller distances. The average equilibrium position of each molecule shifts outward, leading to expansion of the solid.","['extraction of heat. When a body is heated the heat energy and as such the kinetic energy of each molecule of the body increases. In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecule s relative to their equilibrium position'

As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior.

Since intermolecular force is less \nin liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it. For gaseous substances with the increase of temperature the random motion of the molecules increases.

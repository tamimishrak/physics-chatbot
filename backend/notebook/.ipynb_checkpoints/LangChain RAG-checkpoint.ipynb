The regulation was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in April 2019.\n",
       "\n",
       "The EU AI Act has several key objectives:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Promote Trust**: Ensure that AI systems are transparent, explainable, and accountable.\n",
       "2. **Ensure Safety**: Prevent AI systems from causing harm to people or society.\n",
       "3. **Foster Innovation**: Encourage innovation and investment in AI development while ensuring ethical and societal considerations.\n",
       "\n",
       "To achieve these goals, the EU AI Act sets out:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Definition of High-Risk AI Systems**: Identifies certain AI applications (e.g., those related to safety, security, or decision-making) that require specific measures.\n",
       "2. **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**: Requires developers and users to conduct risk assessments and implement measures to mitigate risks associated with AI systems.\n",
       "3. **Transparency and Explainability**: Ensures that AI decisions are transparent and explainable, allowing for human oversight and accountability.\n",
       "4. **Diversity and Non-Discrimination**: Prohibits the use of AI systems that discriminate against individuals or groups based on factors like race, gender, age, etc.\n",
       "5. **Data Protection and Privacy**: Complements existing data protection regulations (GDPR) to ensure the responsible handling of personal data in AI development.\n",
       "6. **Liability and Redress**: Establishes a framework for liability and redress when AI systems cause harm or damage.\n",
       "\n",
       "The EU AI Act also sets out requirements for:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **AI System Design**: Ensures that AI systems are designed with transparency, explainability, and accountability in mind.\n",
       "2. **Testing and Validation**: Requires the testing and validation of AI systems to ensure they meet safety and performance standards.\n",
       "3. **Training and Education**: Promotes training and education on AI development, deployment, and use.\n",

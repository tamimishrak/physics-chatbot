determination of relations among them are the basic foundation of scientific works. 
Galileo introduced the scientific trends of developing mathematical theory and verifying its authenticity through experiment. Later, Newton (1642-1727 A.D) gave it a complete shape. Galileo defined displacement, motion, acceleration, time etc. and determined relations among them. Consequently he di scovered the laws of falling bodies and 
established the foundation of statics. Ne wton by his versatile genius discovered 
mechanics and the three famous laws of mechanics and law of universal gravitation. He also made contribution for optics, heat and sound. He invented calculus, a new branch of 
mathematics.  
The discovery and inventions of the eighteenth and nineteenth century paved the way for  
Europe to industrial revolution. The steam engine of James Watt (1736-1819 A.D) played a vital role for industrial revolution. Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851 A.D) demonstrated the magnetic effect of current. This discovery led Michael Faraday (1791-1867 A.D), Henry (1797-1879 A.D) and Lenz (1804-1865 A.D) towards discovering the fact that magnetic effect produces electric current. In fact, this was a discovery of the 
process of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.  
In 1864 James Clark Maxwell (1831-1879 A.D) demonstrated that light is one kind of 
electromagnetic wave. He established the electromagnetic theory by combining electric and magnetic field. Similar kind of radiati on was also discovered and produced in 1888 
by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894 A.D). Using the same kind of waves in 1896, Marconi (1874-1937 A.D) discovered the method of sending signal through ″Morse code ″ to far 
off distance. Before him Sir Jagadish Cha ndra Basu (1858-1937 A.D) was able to send 
energy from one place to another through electromagnetic wave. In this way radio communication was developed. By the end of nineteenth century Roentgen (1845-1923 A.D) discovered x-rays and Becquerel (1852-1908 A.D) discovered the radio activity of 
uranium.  
In the twentieth century surprising advancement took place in the field of physics. Max 
Planck (1858-1947 A.D) discovered quantum theory of radiation. Albert Einstein (1879-1955 A.D) invented theory of relativity.  These two theories not only explained the previous experimental result but also made some predictions which were experimentally verified. Ernest Rutherford’s (1871-1937 A. D) nuclear theory regarding atoms and Neill 
Bohr’s (1885-1962 A.D) concept of electron layers in the hydrogen atoms were very 
important step of atomic physics.  
The next important discovery was made in 1938. At this time Otto Hann (1879-1968 
A.D) and Stresemann (1902-1980 A.D) found out that nucleus was fissionable. Due to fission a nucleus of large mass number splits up into two nuclei of approximately equal mass number and a part of its mass is converted into energy as a result of which atom ",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 8, 'topic': 'Others'}"

The rate of increase of velocity of a freely falling body on earth due to force of gravity is 
called the acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration due to gravity is represented by 
the letter g.  
The quantities of magnitude of `g’ any place on earth is  
 
 
 Here, M = mass of the earth  
          G = a universal constant, which is called gravitational constant  
          R = Radius of the earth  
As the earth is not perfectly round, the polar regions are a bit compressed, therefore the 
radius of the earth R is not constant. Hence the values of `g’’ is not the same at all places 
on earth. The polar radius `R’ is the shortest and so the value of `g’ at the pole is the 
maximum. And the value of R is the longest at the equator. So the value of `g’ at the equation is the minimum. 
Since the value of `g’ is different at different places on the surface of the earth, its value 
at sea level altitude 45 ° is accepted as the standard value. This standard value of `g’ is 
9.80665ms-2. For convenience the standard valu e of `g’ is taken to be 9.8ms-2 or 9.81ms-2.   
Falling Bodies : If a body is dropped from a certain height, it falls on earth due to the 
influence of gravity. If a heavy and a light object are dropped from the same height simultaneously, will they reach the ground at the same time ?  
In fact, if a piece of stone and a piece of paper are dropped from the same height, it is 
seen that the stone reaches the ground first. Since the acceleration due to gravity does not dropped on the mass of the body, the acceleration of the stone and that of the paper 
would be the same. So they should reach at the same time on the earth, but due to the 
resistance of air two bodies reach at different time on the earth. If there is no resistance of the air, they would fall at the same time.  
Laws of falling bodies :  Galilio discovered three laws relating to falling bodies : These are called laws of 
falling bodies. These laws are applicable onl y for bodies falling from rest without any 
resistance. At the time of falling, the body will ``fall from rest, it will have no initial 
velocity. The body will fall freely without any resistance, that is, no force other than the 
gravitational force will act on the body. For example, the resistance due to air will not act on it.  
Laws of falling bodies are :  
First Law : All bodies falling from rest and from the same height without any resistance 
traverse equal distance in equal time.  Second Law : The velocity (v), acquired by a freely falling body from rest in a given 
time (t) is directly proportional to time that is, v 
∝ t   ",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 44, 'topic': 'Physics'}"

The dimension of speed is the dimension of = distance
time   
∴ [ V ] = [ L / T ] = [ LT-1 ]  
As speed is obtained by the division of distance and time, unit of speed is obtained, by 
the division of units of distance and time.  
Since the unit of distance is meter (m) and unit of time is second (s), unit of speed is 
meter/second (ms-1). 
The speed of a body is 4ms-1 means that the body moves a distance of 4m in 1second.  
Though the unit of speed is meter/second, for our convenience sometimes we consider the unit of speed is kilometer/hour where the unit of distance is kilometer and of time is 
hour. The speedometer of car measures the speed in kmh
-1 .  
Average Speed : If the magnitude of speed does not change during the motion of the 
body, that is if the body travels equal distance in equal interval of time, then the speed of 
the body is called uniform speed. And if the body does not travel equal distance in equal interval of time then the speed is called non uniform speed.  
If a body does not move with uniform speed, then the speed obtained by dividing the 
total distance traveled by time is called average speed.  
So, average speed =   total distance
time  
If a car runs 300 km in 6 hours since 7 in the morning on the way from Dhaka to 
Dinajpur, the average speed of the car is 300km/6h = 50kmh-1. Here, average speed 
50kmh-1 does not mean the car travels 50km in every hour rather it might travel 
sometimes faster or sometimes slower than the average speed.  
Instantaneous speed : If we want to know the instantaneous speed of any body at any 
instant, for example what was the speed of the car just the moment its 33miniutes travel 
is over, the speed of that moment will be the instantaneous speed. To find the 
instantaneous speed at any instant, the distance traveled at during a small interval, has to be known and then the distance has to be divided by the time interval.  
If any one wants to the speed of the car at 10 : 32 : 43 am ( 10 hours 32 minute 43 
second) or at the time of cross over a speed breaker on the highway beside any school, 
he has to see the reading of the speedometer at the moment. Similarly with the help of Rudder or Laser gun we can know whether a car is violating the highest limit on the 
highway or the speed every ball of Mashrafi Bin Murtaja, the fastest bowler of 
Bangladesh national team.  
Velocity : Sometimes during usual conversation many people use the word velocity to 
mean speed. But in science the two words do  not mean the same thing speed indicates 
only the rate of change of position with time, it does not indicate the direction of change ",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is the unit of speed?', 'answer': 'The unit of speed is meter/second (ms-1).'}, {'question': 'How do you calculate average speed?', 'answer': 'Average speed = total distance / time'}], 'seed_document_id': 37, 'topic': 'Physics'}"

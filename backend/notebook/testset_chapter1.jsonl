Later, Newton (1642-1727 A.D) gave it a complete shape. Galileo defined displacement, motion, acceleration, time etc. and determined relations among them. Consequently he di scovered the laws of falling bodies and \nestablished the foundation of statics. Ne wton by his versatile genius discovered \nmechanics and the three famous laws of mechanics and law of universal gravitation. He also made contribution for optics, heat and sound. He invented calculus, a new branch of \nmathematics.  \nThe discovery and inventions of the eighteenth and nineteenth century paved the way for  \nEurope to industrial revolution. The steam engine of James Watt (1736-1819 A.D) played a vital role for industrial revolution. Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851 A.D) demonstrated the magnetic effect of current. This discovery led Michael Faraday (1791-1867 A.D), Henry (1797-1879 A.D) and Lenz (1804-1865 A.D) towards discovering the fact that magnetic effect produces electric current. In fact, this was a discovery of the \nprocess of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.  \nIn 1864 James Clark Maxwell (1831-1879 A.D) demonstrated that light is one kind of \nelectromagnetic wave. He established the electromagnetic theory by combining electric and magnetic field. Similar kind of radiati on was also discovered and produced in 1888 \nby Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894 A.D). Using the same kind of waves in 1896, Marconi (1874-1937 A.D) discovered the method of sending signal through \u2033Morse code \u2033 to far \noff distance. Before him Sir Jagadish Cha ndra Basu (1858-1937 A.D) was able to send \nenergy from one place to another through electromagnetic wave. In this way radio communication was developed. By the end of nineteenth century Roentgen (1845-1923 A.D) discovered x-rays and Becquerel (1852-1908 A.D) discovered the radio activity of \nuranium.  \nIn the twentieth century surprising advancement took place in the field of physics. Max \nPlanck (1858-1947 A.D) discovered quantum theory of radiation. Albert Einstein (1879-1955 A.D) invented theory of relativity.  These two theories not only explained the previous experimental result but also made some predictions which were experimentally verified. Ernest Rutherford\u2019s (1871-1937 A. D) nuclear theory regarding atoms and Neill \nBohr\u2019s (1885-1962 A.D) concept of electron layers in the hydrogen atoms were very \nimportant step of atomic physics.  \nThe next important discovery was made in 1938. At this time Otto Hann (1879-1968 \nA.D) and Stresemann (1902-1980 A.D) found out that nucleus was fissionable. Due to fission a nucleus of large mass number splits up into two nuclei of approximately equal mass number and a part of its mass is converted into energy as a result of which atom ","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":8,"topic":"Others"}}

The acceleration due to gravity is represented by \nthe letter g.  \nThe quantities of magnitude of `g\u2019 any place on earth is  \n \n \n Here, M = mass of the earth  \n          G = a universal constant, which is called gravitational constant  \n          R = Radius of the earth  \nAs the earth is not perfectly round, the polar regions are a bit compressed, therefore the \nradius of the earth R is not constant. Hence the values of `g\u2019\u2019 is not the same at all places \non earth. The polar radius `R\u2019 is the shortest and so the value of `g\u2019 at the pole is the \nmaximum. And the value of R is the longest at the equator. So the value of `g\u2019 at the equation is the minimum. \nSince the value of `g\u2019 is different at different places on the surface of the earth, its value \nat sea level altitude 45 \u00b0 is accepted as the standard value. This standard value of `g\u2019 is \n9.80665ms-2. For convenience the standard valu e of `g\u2019 is taken to be 9.8ms-2 or 9.81ms-2.   \nFalling Bodies : If a body is dropped from a certain height, it falls on earth due to the \ninfluence of gravity. If a heavy and a light object are dropped from the same height simultaneously, will they reach the ground at the same time ?  \nIn fact, if a piece of stone and a piece of paper are dropped from the same height, it is \nseen that the stone reaches the ground first. Since the acceleration due to gravity does not dropped on the mass of the body, the acceleration of the stone and that of the paper \nwould be the same. So they should reach at the same time on the earth, but due to the \nresistance of air two bodies reach at different time on the earth. If there is no resistance of the air, they would fall at the same time.  \nLaws of falling bodies :  Galilio discovered three laws relating to falling bodies : These are called laws of \nfalling bodies. These laws are applicable onl y for bodies falling from rest without any \nresistance. At the time of falling, the body will ``fall from rest, it will have no initial \nvelocity. The body will fall freely without any resistance, that is, no force other than the \ngravitational force will act on the body. For example, the resistance due to air will not act on it.  \nLaws of falling bodies are :  \nFirst Law : All bodies falling from rest and from the same height without any resistance \ntraverse equal distance in equal time.  Second Law : The velocity (v), acquired by a freely falling body from rest in a given \ntime (t) is directly proportional to time that is, v \n\u221d t   ","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":44,"topic":"Physics"}}

The speedometer of car measures the speed in kmh\n-1 .  \nAverage Speed : If the magnitude of speed does not change during the motion of the \nbody, that is if the body travels equal distance in equal interval of time, then the speed of \nthe body is called uniform speed. And if the body does not travel equal distance in equal interval of time then the speed is called non uniform speed.  \nIf a body does not move with uniform speed, then the speed obtained by dividing the \ntotal distance traveled by time is called average speed.  \nSo, average speed =   total distance\ntime  \nIf a car runs 300 km in 6 hours since 7 in the morning on the way from Dhaka to \nDinajpur, the average speed of the car is 300km\/6h = 50kmh-1. Here, average speed \n50kmh-1 does not mean the car travels 50km in every hour rather it might travel \nsometimes faster or sometimes slower than the average speed.  \nInstantaneous speed : If we want to know the instantaneous speed of any body at any \ninstant, for example what was the speed of the car just the moment its 33miniutes travel \nis over, the speed of that moment will be the instantaneous speed. To find the \ninstantaneous speed at any instant, the distance traveled at during a small interval, has to be known and then the distance has to be divided by the time interval.  \nIf any one wants to the speed of the car at 10 : 32 : 43 am ( 10 hours 32 minute 43 \nsecond) or at the time of cross over a speed breaker on the highway beside any school, \nhe has to see the reading of the speedometer at the moment. Similarly with the help of Rudder or Laser gun we can know whether a car is violating the highest limit on the \nhighway or the speed every ball of Mashrafi Bin Murtaja, the fastest bowler of \nBangladesh national team.  \nVelocity : Sometimes during usual conversation many people use the word velocity to \nmean speed.
